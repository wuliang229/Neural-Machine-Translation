you know , one of the great <unk> in the travel , and one of the joys of the <unk> research is to live together with the people that are still remember the old days , and the joys of the <unk> research is to taste it in the <unk> flick of plants .
just the idea of the <unk> of the mind , the <unk> of the <unk> are important , but just as a model of reality , as a result of reality , as a result of reality , as a result of a group of particular possibilities that our ancestors , although successful , although we &apos;re doing , although we &apos;ve succeeded in front of a few generations .
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we &apos;re going through <unk> .
we need to be <unk> by the <unk> separation by death , and so it shouldn &apos;t be surprising to us all sing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique note of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it &apos;s not a role in the sahara in the sahara , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or even a <unk> hanging everest , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are other other ways of thinking , other ways , other ways to orientation , to the earth .
and this is a notion that if you think about it , just can meet hope .
together , the myriad of the <unk> cultures form a web of <unk> and <unk> life that <unk> the earth and the idea of the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> can be considered the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , <unk> and <unk> , which became defined by the human imagination for the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species of species .
and just like the biosphere was taken over and removed the biosphere , this was going to be on the same speed -- only with greater speed .
not a biologist , for instance , that 50 percent or more of all species are being true about the extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of biological diversity -- almost hardly the one that we &apos;re facing as a <unk> of cultural diversity .
and the key evidence of this is the extinction of languages .
when any of you were born in this room , the world was spoken on the earth 6,000 languages .
now , language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture has to find the physical world .
each language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a pivotal point , a subject , an ecosystem more than .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , half of them are not going to be <unk> in the ears of children .
you won &apos;t teach the two more . that means if nothing is being done , it &apos;s actually already dead .
what could be lonely than the speaker of being told one of the last one of your people who speak to you have no way to give the wisdom of ancestors , or to give hope to the hope of ancestors ?
and yet this terrible thing is actually happening somewhere on earth , about all two weeks , because of all two weeks , one older man dies and takes the last <unk> of an old language with himself .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better so ? &quot; not better to be ? &quot; would it not be a better place , if we all speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s get this language of being a little , let &apos;s be <unk> .
let them be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see it , as if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
so i want to take you through a journey today , a journey through the <unk> , a quick journey through the <unk> to try to understand what &apos;s actually gone lost .
now there are some of us who are kind of forgotten that when i say , &quot; different ways of existence , &quot; really different ways of existence .
take example , for example , this child &apos;s child in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> from the east , the <unk> of sacred snakes .
this is a people which don &apos;t have <unk> between the colors of blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest that are being depended upon the people .
they have a strange language , and a <unk> <unk> to call the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who is a different language .
all of this complexity in the <unk> past , and this is what happens to these big houses that are <unk> in these big houses , where you &apos;re going to talk about the <unk> six or seven languages , you never hear someone who learns language .
they just stop and start talking .
or one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first time was contacted in 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> can come and made a <unk> error .
they took <unk> photographs of the air , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , and forgot that these people are seeing the last year in their life that we never saw anything .
they took these photographs of the forest , and they were looking at the face or the character , they found nothing and <unk> that this is the business cards of the united states and they were killing the five <unk> with the <unk> .
but the <unk> killed not just the <unk> with the <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths were happening by <unk> .
we were taking eight generations , and found two instances of one natural generations , and found two instances of one natural generations , and when we were <unk> , they gave them that one of the people was so old that he died because of his day , and we still killed him with the <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a clear background of the forests , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of the animal from 40 steps and determine what animal that owned .
in the early years of the years , i got a really amazing job when i was interested in the harvard , and i was interested in creating haiti and <unk> the secret communities , the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> were and the poison that used to be used to make sure of what they were doing .
to give you a sense to give a sense to this remarkable belief , of course , about this remarkable belief , and <unk> , and <unk> is not a <unk> of black magic .
so , the opposite of the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you to the great world of world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , whatever .
a continent will always leave , because the presumption that there was no religious belief , and of course , there was one and <unk> religious thought that &apos;s the very profound religious thought , which is the tragic state of the <unk> .
but what makes it so interesting is that living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living ones that ghosts .
the minds can be <unk> by the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to be the soul of living in the middle of the living , so that the <unk> for a brief <unk> moment to god .
<unk> <unk> like , &quot; your white is going to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and we &apos;ll become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take away from the mind . how can you get damage to it ?
and look at these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal without <unk> <unk> , an amazing demo of the mind the ability to influence the body so that it &apos;s <unk> when it &apos;s going to be <unk> into the extreme of the extreme .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met was the <unk> from the sierra nevada de <unk> de <unk> , the most extraordinary .
and the old <unk> civilization , the heart of the caribbean sailed the heart of the caribbean , and in the course of the time , this people would have moved into a <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s going to be on the <unk> of the <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who had never been killed by the <unk> .
and then , to the day , they will be a ritual <unk> . that education is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> , they are separated from three and four years of their families , and they &apos;re <unk> in a <unk> world of the darkness , <unk> for 18 years , to be elected to the <unk> of the pregnancy , and they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the pregnancy , they would have now <unk> their own mother &apos;s lap to the big mother .
and throughout all that time , they are being culturally aligned in the values of their society , values that the claim that their prayers , their prayers , and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that green -- balance .
at the end of this stunning , <unk> , you &apos;ll start to see a <unk> . and in this <unk> moment of the first light , and the sun starts to be the point of the first light in the <unk> , and in this <unk> moment of the first light , and the sun starts to see the <unk> of the first beautiful landscape , and the preacher starts to come back and says , &quot; look , it &apos;s really , like i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
so , whenever we think about <unk> and landscape we &apos;re either <unk> and <unk> the old <unk> of the cool wild , which is a <unk> thought , or a <unk> thought , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , being <unk> , they are not <unk> , they &apos;re also going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for <unk> or <unk> , but yet , through time and ritual , that &apos;s not to be consciously close to a very <unk> intuition , which is the idea that earth can only exist , because it &apos;s being <unk> into the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means a little kid from the andes , which is , in the way , it &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and that &apos;s a different way to this resource or this place , as a little kid from montana , that &apos;s going to be able to get away from a mountain pile .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> <unk> and believed that these forests are being <unk> .
and this made me to another person when my friends among the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> spirits are the spirits to live the world of the world , the way they would participate in their <unk> .
now , if you start to think that this idea of looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i only took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard the most powerful value of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what makes it fascinating to be so fascinating is not just the most fundamental potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s made by two different sources , and on the one hand , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is , it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s made a <unk> of <unk> smoke on her consciousness , but it &apos;s actually <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> with the name of <unk> <unk> .
this plant contains some very <unk> <unk> that are serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , that substance that you also create from different species also creates <unk> .
this <unk> is a <unk> <unk> at a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and land landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create a <unk> of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have been talking about my professor , richard evan <unk> , who was the <unk> <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said that , i said , you could not be able to compose this <unk> as a <unk> , because in the moment you feel the effects , you &apos;re not there to experience a <unk> .
but the thing about <unk> is that you can &apos;t be taken by a <unk> , because you &apos;re going to be <unk> by the human gut , it &apos;s <unk> with names of <unk> .
you can only be taken into a connected with some other chemicals that the mao <unk> .
now the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that have in the <unk> are actually <unk> from the kind of thing that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . so you ask yourself .
how can these people from a <unk> of <unk> plants are not finding out the amount of <unk> plants , which , if in this way , it combined a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole greater is greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , and try and error , and what it turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians you &apos;re saying , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 versions of <unk> that they &apos;re all in the forest that they &apos;re seeing in the forest they &apos;re going to see in the forest that they &apos;re very much .
and then you ask them how they looked at their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to understand something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that you take the 17 separate varieties of <unk> and you &apos;re singing to one in a different sample .
now , this is not a <unk> at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the problem that the problem is that even the people who have been for love of the difficult situation to the <unk> , you &apos;re looking at the <unk> and the <unk> , but you &apos;re kind of looking at the past , as the real world , is that our world , at least .
so the fact is that you &apos;re going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not to be a <unk> , in which we &apos;ve been present and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either , and <unk> <unk> , so the problem is not change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> never stopped being less to the sioux , as they bow and the following the world , when americans stopped being the horse and the <unk> .
not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> , it &apos;s power . it &apos;s ugly face of sovereignty .
and wherever you go to the world , you &apos;re going to find out that these cultures are not the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the willing to be willing to go out of the <unk> with raw <unk> , they &apos;re willing to fill their <unk> with raw <unk> , they have the forest in the woods , or like the <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s been <unk> .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research , you will see this ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the most enterprising extinction extinction is becoming a common , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle of the people , not only being judged , but generally and <unk> , as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , you can &apos;t understand if you &apos;ve not seen it at the <unk> level .
i went through the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i saw the statistics of the statistics that sounds like 6,000 sacred buildings that have been transformed into rubble and ash , and 1.2 million people were killed during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as followers of the <unk> .
that meant that he was murdered during the chinese invasion of being killed .
his uncle , his holiness , the diaspora put people in nepal .
his mother was locked as punishment -- to be the <unk> of the crime .
he was in the age of two , in the age of her , to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister that was <unk> , was brought into a <unk> .
and one day it came from accidentally <unk> , and for those <unk> , they had to work for seven years in a tough camp .
the suffering is <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of humans is a little bit more <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really , in a choice , we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist she said that it &apos;s the greatest fear that he was saying that , as we were to see a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> view , we would see that we would have to wake up in a dream of a dream , and forgot that there were any other ways .
and it &apos;s imperative to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , the <unk> revolution , and we &apos;ve had the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> , the <unk> poetry of <unk> <unk> and hierarchy , specialization , was just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world is almost 300 years old .
now , this shallow story i don &apos;t tell you that we have all the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the ensuing millennia .
if we were asked by these <unk> , the meaning of human being , answers with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will become the possibility of what we &apos;re like , with regard to consciousness that are important to the importance of all humans and gardens , to be <unk> , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
this is a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> , i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government isn &apos;t always been very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years , the <unk> of our domination , they were forced to move into settlements .
the grandfather refused to be an old man .
the family that fear was that fear took all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit aren &apos;t the fear of the cold , and they used them to the advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> were originally made from fish that was wrapped in <unk> .
the grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the flying storm .
he <unk> out , made his pants from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand , and when the air hits the air began , he made it in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the sides of the <unk> and it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> the dishes , took the dog &apos;s the dog and a <unk> , <unk> , another dog , and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> belt .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is in many ways a symbol for the opposition of the inuit and all the world in the world .
the canadian government gave the entire control of the <unk> in april 1999 , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all control of the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the <unk> of the people and can go to the <unk> .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us to reach the earth to see the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
they are the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are the dreams of our own children in the world of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do with national geographic is that we believe politicians will never achieve something .
we think that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> -- we believe that the world is not persuasive , but we &apos;re probably probably the best institution in storytelling , and our website get 35 million <unk> every month .
we send <unk> countries to our <unk> .
our magazines are being from millions .
and we do a series of trips to the <unk> , where we take our audience to the <unk> of the <unk> , where we &apos;ve got to do this in the world , to have different ways that we can find a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world where the wisdom of all humans can do to our shared well-being .
thank you .
what i do you first , as quickly as possible , show the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft to do is to show you , that &apos;s a new technology that we have microsoft to do with a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> environment that you can either be locally or removed from huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many of the <unk> here , and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , in any sense , can new .
and it &apos;s no matter how many information we are looking at , how big these collections are or how big the pictures are .
most of you are digital footage of a camera , but this one is a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like that , is the number of digital digital activists on your screen at every moment , it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house house of <unk> . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this , to really show that this one is a representation of the <unk> and no picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and this is really what pleasure and the good experience of a real <unk> magazine , to read a newspaper , or a newspaper , a kind of medium with a number of scales .
we also have a little bit at the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technological intervention .
and this really is really these ideas to stop this limitations for available space .
we hope that no <unk> and other rubbish is that it means not necessary .
of course , the production is a really <unk> application for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we will be contributing to this field .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s take a little different .
this is actually live on the internet , you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research on <unk> , which is a <unk> research , which is a <unk> research , which is a <unk> university , under the advice of steve <unk> on the <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done , and a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see that if we can create this kind of perspective where we can go through images and make this experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the pictures here is actually meaning .
the <unk> have been packing so that they were <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the canadian <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re going to be able to see elements of <unk> slides or <unk> <unk> , and these things were going to happen in the relationship .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are what , that are much more nuanced .
i &apos;d like to show it right now , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and this is the punchline behind the <unk> , which is , really , the punchline behind this technology , the <unk> , and this is not necessarily as obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about lawyers and so forth .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral of <unk> , who had just <unk> pictures of flickr , just give you <unk> pictures of men in the computer with images of flickr , and they &apos;re getting some pictures of men in the computer , and on the <unk> , and each of this orange cone represents a picture that was discovered as a model model .
so these are all <unk> , and they &apos;re all standing in the same way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never thought i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : all of them are : all of the <unk> <unk> , a very large number of them all of these environments were being <unk> .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of them are covered by faces .
somewhere there are a bunch of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , that was right .
we can change the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environments , and it &apos;s going to take data from all of all of them -- from all the collective memory of that , what &apos;s happening earth looks like -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs are interconnected and it &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that &apos;s coming from all the earth .
so , look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , and they use it to be greater and greater and the use for the user .
their own photos will be brought to the metadata that has collected a different person .
if somebody who has been willing to go and tell you , i &apos;m going to use it as a starting to start using this data to dive into this room , in these <unk> , the photos of other people , and thus , and so , and so , and this is a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> of social experience to use other kinds of pathologies .
and of course , the <unk> all of these are the immense range of virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , which is not only got through <unk> or satellite and so forth , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i get you right ? i &apos;m understanding that ? you know , it enables to a certain point , within the next years , all of the images that are used in common in the world are in principle being connected ?
yeah . you don &apos;t find anything else .
if you want them to be <unk> between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these images have .
like if you do a <unk> for pictures where you attach sentences to you , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about that , which is the picture that you do .
but how would it be like this , when the image is you wired to fill all of these pictures ?
then the complexity of <unk> <unk> and abundance that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is really incredible . so congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which i hope to do with other things that you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make some of the connections if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies .
the official <unk> works , if our goal is to maximize our citizens , this is especially by the <unk> of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom to be good in itself , valuable , is a <unk> response to human .
if people have freedom , each of us is to do the things that maximize our good good , and no one has to decide to us .
to maximize freedom is choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , deeply deeply in our water supply that it doesn &apos;t matter to question it .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress is possible .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i want to just say something about <unk> .
there &apos;s been <unk> <unk> in my supermarket when you &apos;re not going to buy the 10 different <unk> , and 12 <unk> they could buy a big number of their own lettuce , in which unlikely case , that no deficit mining , in the store for you , is right .
so this is like the supermarket .
and then you go to the <unk> business to make a stereo <unk> -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> , and in this room , there &apos;s so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together <unk> million different kinds of information plants that are offered to be offered in this one .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have had a phone , you know , as long as it came from your favorite bell .
you &apos;ve rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that , that the phone was never shut .
that days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this is the mobile phones in the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and if you don &apos;t have to see it until you &apos;ve seen in your business , you can be sure that you will soon be going .
and what it does is it is to make people walk into business and ask them .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone doesn &apos;t do it .
in other aspects of life that are much more <unk> than you are to buy objects , the same explosion of choice .
public health -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to a doctor and the doctor says they could do , we could make a difference or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risk .
b has these benefits and risk . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has got these benefits and risk and b has the benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but it &apos;s a shift from the burden of the responsibility of someone who knows something -- <unk> the doctor -- to someone who &apos;s nothing , and most likely to do , and that &apos;s why the best constitution is to make a decision -- <unk> the patient .
there &apos;s tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs like you and me , that if you think about it , no sense , no sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they finance to us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to come in the doctor &apos;s next morning and request a change in the prescription .
something like our identity is now a question of choice , and that &apos;s what this slide is supposed to show .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we invent them .
and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves so much as we want .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the <unk> was that almost everybody had one had one had one had one had one , and they could <unk> as quickly as they could , and then they were able to get kids as much as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who &quot; no matter , and not what they were doing .
now , it &apos;s all just to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re fewer carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you &apos;re asking yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i just get kids , or do i just want to make a career ? &quot;
they are all <unk> questions .
and you will answer these questions , whether it means all the tasks that i &apos;m willing to do , and you don &apos;t have a good grade grade in my course .
and indeed , you should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to work with the paradox of technology that lets us allow us to work every day from every day of every single place on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s actually a corner of the corner that i &apos;m not going to tell anyone about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make a choice in terms of work , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our children at football , and we have our mobile phone to the one , and our blackberry on the other hip , and our laptop probably on our own lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off the <unk> , every minute we &apos;re going to take our child , you ask a <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to ask this call , &quot; should i assume this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , no , no , &quot; is it certainly being your experience of your child &apos;s experience of your child &apos;s experience of your child .
everywhere we look , big things and the little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we lived in the city looked like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all of it was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re now looking at life looks like this .
and the question is , is the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be a bad thing about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a <unk> way , is that it <unk> instead of free .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s really hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of a study of investment in volunteers .
one of me had access to <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> of the company , the <unk> , took up to two percent .
they &apos;re offering 50 dollars to -- 10 percent less employees than if they were only going to be five . why ?
because there are 50 key points to be a choice , it &apos;s so hard to choose that it would go in the morning .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , tomorrow and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come from .
understanding that this isn &apos;t just that people need to eat food if you go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to the <unk> , it means that the decisions make so hard that they &apos;re missing large <unk> of their anguish .
they &apos;re not going to be <unk> by <unk> , to 5,000 , a year , on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a series of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s a way that the world looks like this .
you want to make the decision that you make , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment to vote , or even the wrong <unk> .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we get to flow and make paralysis , we end up less content with the outcome of the choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide between less choices .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is to imagine that they would have been better , and what happens is that this stunning <unk> alternative will have been better , and what happens is that regret is the decision that you regret , and this regret seems negative on satisfaction that you had made of their own trial , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there is the easier , the easier it is to make any <unk> for the choices that they make .
secondly , what economists call .
dan gilbert has made a big point today by telling how much the way we compare to do it depends on what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think , it &apos;s just to be attractive qualities of alternatives that you &apos;re willing to be <unk> with the alternative that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have everything for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; suck &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he has missed two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility , day day , a great parking lot .
<unk> <unk> down the satisfaction that we get through our selection , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more ways to give it , the more attractive qualities of this kind of choice will be beneficial to the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a few of the messages .
he &apos;s making a statement about it in now and maybe to be able to do things about it .
but a key thing that he does is , who is deciding who you decide to do a decision to do other things .
and these other things may have taken more attractive qualities , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this has made me , when i was going to share my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all time .
and there was a time in which it just gave me , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve bought a lot of <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had been carried enough and often they have enough , they started to have &quot; ok . &quot;
so , to buy new gear after a many years of the old <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; you want to <unk> , slightly <unk> or heavy ?
do you want to the buttons or <unk> or washed up .
do you want to leave with you ?
if you want to cut down , you know , <unk> , blah blah blah , &quot; and so on .
my jaw down , and after i was recovered , i would like to have , &quot; i like to have the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what was that , so i spent an hour all of these <unk> jeans , and that &apos;s the business -- and i &apos;m saying the truth -- with the best appropriate , the best appropriate thing i ever had .
i had better it better . all of these choices made it better to me .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to explain to me .
the reason i felt worse with all of these available possibilities , my expectations for which , for a good few , it &apos;s going to be high .
i had very low expectations . i had no expectations of a lot when it was just in a kind of way .
when you get in 100 species , it should be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was expecting to do , and what i was in was a <unk> of what i expected .
the addition to the people &apos;s lives is inevitably , people who are doing it , and they have to be good about how good these choices are .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world &apos;s <unk> knows that , because if you would know what it &apos;s going to do .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to be better than anything worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was to make it possible for people to make a comfortable surprise .
nowadays , in the world we live in -- we live , <unk> , muslim citizens , with perfection as an expectation , the best for you can hope to do things as well as you are expecting to hope to do it .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have been better . i didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always a bad thing .
and finally , a follow of the <unk> down to a <unk> is that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask why , why is it being dissatisfied , and you ask why , you know , the answer is , the world is responsible . what would you have to do ?
and when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , and you ask why , who &apos;s in charge ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have been able to do it better .
with 100 different kinds of <unk> in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for error .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they &apos;re <unk> about it .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only thing , but a <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that people have learned the <unk> because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences themselves , think it would be your fault .
and so the <unk> thing that we &apos;re going to seem better better , is , is , it &apos;s empathy , and we feel worse .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think about right , completely fake . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that makes something better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow , that &apos;s more choices better than something .
there &apos;s a magic crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point long to make our greater life .
now , as an policy question -- i &apos;m almost ready -- as an policy question , which is to think about how to think about what all of these selection is to the developed societies , is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard a lot of them , whose problem is not too big .
and their problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and being angry , steve <unk> told you about how this is more expensive and hard to not help the car seats , it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that you don &apos;t help .
they even hurts .
they &apos;re worried about that , stand up with this .
if something of what makes our society makes us making decisions that makes people too little choices in people , dignity , not only the lives of people improve , but our dignity also would improve .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to be concerned that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big selection give us .
finally , read this cartoon , and i &apos;m an advanced person saying , &quot; ah ! what ?
you can &apos;t know anything in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that the way i &apos;ve ever read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i got to see the fish that &apos;s going to know .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , you &apos;ve got everything , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , it &apos;s possible , it &apos;s ripped satisfaction .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost limited to perfect safety -- possibly for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is the <unk> of a metaphor of <unk> , a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects , about the human genome and what that might mean and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we have to have developed biology , and we &apos;re now trying to build the digital code into a new phase of biology , to build new lives and build .
we &apos;ve always been trying to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i believe many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to use different approaches to simplify the minimum of the minimum of these components .
we &apos;ve been doing almost 20 years , and when we took the <unk> , we &apos;ve been able to have the change from the analog world of biology to digital world .
now , let &apos;s try to ask , whether we can live and can create new lives , and we &apos;re going to make new life , from this digital universe ?
this map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , who can replicate the smallest genome of a species that can replicate themselves in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes , to get the 500 genes , or whatever that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to what we do . i trust you all , that &apos;s easy . but if we &apos;re all looking at all these genes , one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to be able to identify the only way to identify this chromosome , actually , to identify the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to <unk> the question , we can <unk> a chromosome ?
does it really allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and if we can , we can start to launch chromosome chromosome ?
a chromosome is so just a piece of <unk> chemistry material .
our steps in the <unk> of life was exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly but increased , and our last point would be on an exponential curve now .
we started to start with 15 years ago .
it took a few years of starting to review the <unk> before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out to be a very difficult thing to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of power , the more mistakes is going to happen .
so we had to develop a new method of putting these little bits and make the mistakes available .
this was our first attempt to try and with the digital piece , the genome x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus virus kill bacteria .
we made little bits , made a <unk> , and had a dna molecule by about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came up when we took this piece of <unk> and then put this piece of paper into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made sure of particles .
the viral particles were released and then came back and <unk> e.
i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry , and they said they could see this model .
they laughed more than you do here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that we can actually build your hardware hardware , in a biological system .
but we wanted to go even further . so we thought , it has more than <unk> characters , and it has more than <unk> characters , and it has more than <unk> characters , and it has more than <unk> characters , and it has more than the size of the <unk> , which is the single components of the <unk> cell .
design is the key , and if you want to launch with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really accurate .
when we took the genome first of 1995 , the <unk> was an error with 10,000 pairs of pairs .
we found out the <unk> 30 mistake , if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces , you create the 50 letters and the other <unk> add to overlap , to build smaller <unk> , so that they fit .
we have these <unk> elements here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> into this .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and ts .
so , <unk> of these characters -- these letters are actually about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose of purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
initially , we &apos;ve signed .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so we could just multiply them with enzymes , and there are the enzymes that repair these repair and bring together again .
and we started making pieces , starting with the <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , added these together to make <unk> for the <unk> to <unk> this back up to the <unk> .
in each step we have produced these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process that will be seen in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big bits pairs pairs pairs , and then they &apos;re not just going to grow into e. coli , and it &apos;s beyond all the possibilities of modern biology , and so we used to use other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called the <unk> <unk> , which is using biology to fix dna that can combine those pieces .
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> , the three million rads of radiation .
you see the upper field that you just fall chromosome .
12 to 24 hours later , everything was so <unk> like it .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move , looking for extraterrestrial conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of that out there .
so here &apos;s a <unk> molecule that we built by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve only used <unk> with the right design of the pieces , we have them <unk> , and yeast then automatically put together .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are shots over a period of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve been asked recently .
these are over <unk> letters of <unk> code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever been built by humans .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it to a <unk> from 10 and without any <unk> , it would include <unk> sides , just to <unk> this genetic code .
now , how do we do a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in <unk> like it , you just take the water out and there &apos;s another place in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
and in <unk> , the chromosome in the cell is just showing , but recently we showed that you can get a complete transplant a <unk> of a cell to another , and then we can activate this .
we &apos;ve been able to pick up the chromosome of a <unk> . and so , these two are the other people we could pick up , and we &apos;ve got this chromosome , and it was very amazing to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we gave it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very <unk> version here .
the new chromosome was going into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get a little bit more .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we &apos;ve been finding all sorts of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , each time , thousands of characteristics just one second to a species .
so people who have evolution in evolution , as a gene , that &apos;s going to be changed by biology .
there are enzymes enzymes are the <unk> , which actually is the dna digest .
the chromosome that was not one of the cell ; the chromosomes we put in there .
it was <unk> in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> out because of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , all of the characteristics of species lost species , and <unk> completely into new species based on the new software that we gave in the cell .
all of the proteins change the membranes , when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been going on .
it may sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , things really dramatically change .
now , i &apos;ve argued that this isn &apos;t the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we might potentially be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion that could be massive new <unk> based on this digital era .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re about six and six billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in the year of the year .
today , three people on this planet had been in the year in 1994 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , <unk> , fuel for six billion people .
it &apos;s going to provide a challenge for nine .
we need to need five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil , that &apos;s hundreds of millions of <unk> on the day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it will challenge a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 from this material that land on it .
we now have , from our discoveries around the world , a database , with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen circle and see the diversity of that emerged .
we &apos;re entering the limits of biological reality and the other of our minds .
we &apos;ve got technologies today to this quick amount to do what we call <unk> genetics .
so we have to have a chance to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosome a day .
if you think about this 20 million different genes , to optimize these processes , to optimize the <unk> , or drugs new vaccines , we can only change a single group of biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a photograph of the actual <unk> of the ones that you &apos;re actually sitting in and <unk> new species on the computer design .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how the genetic code is going to look .
we &apos;re going to focus on the fossil &apos;s fourth generation .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> of the <unk> and third generation that are going to be going to be going to be the much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of pathologies .
but , as we think about biology , a huge impact on food , or the limitation of their availability , is that if we &apos;re seeing co2 as the material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path .
and we think we &apos;re going to think we &apos;re going to be the first with <unk> the fourth generation and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 in methane to use hydrogen as energy source .
we investigate whether we can use carbon footprint , which just can be put in <unk> , <unk> the co2 into the fuel to make this process .
within a brief period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire observable industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else it could do ? you know , how to get a <unk> of energy .
but the same way we &apos;re working on is to use the same work for developing vaccines .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always going to roll a year and get a dollar to a little bit , if it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s what can be changed by using <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what the future might be sped with changes , it &apos;s sped up with <unk> bacteria , <unk> , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we &apos;re getting light light from people to improve people , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do this , thank you very much .
last ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s far as it , and for all of those who were not there at the time , the lhc was the greatest scientific experiment that has ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
and his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second , and it existed in the universe -- and it existed to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking breathtaking .
this is the machine underneath the geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> detectors in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he called atlas <unk> -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
this is a spectacular picture of the atlas of the graph that you see the scale .
10th september last year , the machine ran the machine for the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
it caused huge <unk> in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture image of the first <unk> that the entire route to get the lhc , are actually routinely <unk> , with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image at the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , what a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know whether this was the biggest <unk> , or this , as someone who went to the google and went to the front page .
it means that we &apos;ve reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with this <unk> with these wires -- this golden wires here .
these are <unk> <unk> , when the machine is going on .
well , engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
they can afford that because if you heat them down very far , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
so if you &apos;re in minus <unk> , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can be tension .
in one of the connections between <unk> magnets , there was a <unk> .
and so that heat that <unk> and <unk> <unk> is suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is , and if you imagine that the magnet is about 20 tons and then shifted to about 30 inches .
so we &apos;re damaged , so we &apos;re damaged .
and they were going to take away , whatever we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all over their way back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> .
we &apos;ll turn it back , and expect first data to be in june or july , and we put our journey to find out what the building blocks are .
now , of course , in a kind of negotiation , crashes , the debate has to be the value of science and <unk> to the limitations , it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard that we reach beyond our limitations , it forms the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to be <unk> by his <unk> words , his writer , <unk> <unk> , who said our scientific idea is that our scientific beliefs are so that there are no mystery in nature , that there are no mystery in nature that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a novelist .
books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change the ever thing .
but the recent thing is a bit whimsical in my life and my career , which has been brought me to <unk> my connection to this work .
this strange event was that i wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- love <unk> -- that , decided , unlike all my previous books , for some reason , had gone out and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the upshot of that is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated , i would be treated by the fall .
seriously , the fall of falling !
for example , come up to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you never will be <unk> ?
don &apos;t you worry about it , that you would have a life and never again get a book , and you never get anyone in the world ?
okay , that &apos;s really the courage to do .
it would be worse if i don &apos;t remember that i was going to remember about 20 years ago when i first told when i first told the same kind of <unk> , i was going to be a writer , with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t have any fear of being success ?
do you have no fear that you kill the humiliation of a <unk> ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to make your life long and never get a bit of something that you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with bitter <unk> failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;ve got a lot more things that nobody would get to the answer .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i ask myself , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logically that by somebody should be expected to be afraid of doing the work of doing the work he &apos;s going to feel like to do ?
and what &apos;s right right now with the creatives , that you &apos;re giving us to express the relationship of the mutual <unk> -- in a way of other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , who he was asked to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you get ?
it just didn &apos;t occur , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been getting <unk> people &apos;s reputation .
we &apos;ve seen the kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creatives of all the <unk> , seem to be mentally unstable .
everything you have to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds in the 20th century , the young and often died of their own .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have <unk> <unk> seemed to be really neglected by their talent .
norman <unk> , shortly in his death , he was killing his death in his last interview , and i was killing me a little bit .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your <unk> .
but we don &apos;t even think we &apos;ve heard somebody like this , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of information for so long , and we &apos;re collectively accepted and <unk> and <unk> , creativity and suffering , of course , and that art -- the end -- it &apos;s always going to be the <unk> .
the question i want to ask everybody here is : is this idea of all right ?
so feel that you think about it , because with just one inch , i feel not comfortable with this notion of all .
i think they &apos;re really <unk> .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch it &apos;s going to be taken into the next century .
i think it better if we live our big creative habit .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , the dark path of the presumption , in the way that i &apos;m just in my career .
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write about now is going to be judged by the world as the work after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it <unk> , because we &apos;re all here to be a lot of friends -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest success behind me lies .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that someone can get to get 9 o &apos;clock morning , gin and i don &apos;t want to do that .
i would rather be doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the <unk> , i feel that i have to write about <unk> psychological projects .
somehow i have to find a way to write a secure distance to true between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is going to be the writing .
and in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for models to see other societies , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , to see whether they might have better or <unk> ideas about how to help help with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
this is a quest that took me old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they thought that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity , <unk> <unk> .
from socrates , it &apos;s known that he thought he would have a <unk> who was going to go back from further distance .
the roman had the same idea called this kind of <unk> of the mind , a <unk> genius <unk> .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really mean that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they thought that a genius was literally living in the walls of a <unk> , something like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist in the process of the work , it would be <unk> and the outcome of the work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological implication that will protect you from your work .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was protected , in some kind of things , like , for example , too much , <unk> .
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t get all of you for you . everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work is <unk> -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west would have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything was changed , and we had this big idea , and we had this big idea , and we had this big idea , and we had this big idea , and it &apos;s all the gods and mystery -- and there &apos;s no room more for the spiritual creatures that are embracing from divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to think that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people like this or the artist a genius , instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a mere person he thinks he &apos;s like the <unk> , and the essence , the <unk> and the source of all of the divine , creative , <unk> , is an <unk> <unk> , a little bit of a lot of responsibility to make them a <unk> , human psychology .
it &apos;s like somebody to swallow the sun .
and it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> of our artist has annihilated our <unk> for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps , to a very old understanding of people , and to return to the mystery of the creative part .
maybe not .
perhaps we can get out of <unk> from 500 years , we can &apos;t get extinct in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically , <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to have all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is : why not ?
why not that that ?
because it makes equally sense of all the way that i &apos;ve heard when it was about the absolute crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s -- like everybody who ever attempted to do something , so in other words , actually everybody here -- not quite reasonable .
in fact , sometimes it can feel really <unk> .
i met a little bit of the extraordinary american poet american poet who now went to 90 , but she told me that when you were in the <unk> virginia , she was going out in the fields , and she said she would feel like a poem about the landscape of the landscape .
she said it was like a <unk> train .
the land that would be on her land .
it felt like it was , because it would take earth under the body .
she knew that in one moment , she could only do one of the way , and that was -- in your words -- <unk> running like the devil <unk> .
you ran like the devil <unk> as she was being heard of this poem , it was only about that , you know , enough to get a sheet of paper and a pencil to get it , if it could go through it and contract and capture on the sheet .
and they didn &apos;t get fast enough . they ran and ran , but they ran the house , and they didn &apos;t give it up and they missed it . she said it would go on land , and -- as she said , <unk> after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget that -- she said that there were moments in which they almost showed it .
so , she &apos;s running home and she looks for paper and she &apos;s looking for paper and she &apos;s looking for paper and she grabs a pencil , and then you &apos;re going to <unk> it when it <unk> and then -- she said -- was it like to grab the other hand and get it to get it .
she <unk> the poem of his tail and took it back into her body and took it back to paper .
and the opportunity came to the poem was <unk> and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
and when i heard that , i was just <unk> , this is a little thing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i need to get up every day at the same time , and sweat , <unk> , really unpleasant <unk> .
but even in my mind , i sometimes have this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done this too .
and i had work , or ideas that are from a source of me that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we get to the relationship with no understanding our minds , but to actually end us in the opposite of mental health .
for me , the best example of how you can create this , and the musicians , i was able to interview him a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s the embodiment of modern modern artist , who was trying to be able to do this <unk> creative impulse that lived in it and with them with it .
but then he became older and quiet , he told me that one day he went on a coconut in los angeles , and there was all changed for him .
he went through high speed when he &apos;s suddenly a little fragment of a melody , which is often difficult for him to be <unk> , and he wants to be you . it &apos;s <unk> . he <unk> that , but he can &apos;t grab it .
he has no piece of paper , he has no pen , he doesn &apos;t have any <unk> .
so he starts to start with these old <unk> in it , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be <unk> by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t get to .
but instead of panic , it just stopped .
he was leaving all of the whole of mind , and he did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , <unk> , i can &apos;t see that i drive car ?
<unk> can i see a song like this ?
if you really want to be there , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , you know , somebody else &apos;s minds today .
go and <unk> cohen cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the job . that was often as dark as ever as ever .
but the process and the severe <unk> that surrounds it , was <unk> , when he surrounds nothing as a hassle , and then he had <unk> where he was sort of came from , he realized that it &apos;s not to be a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , wonder , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , of course , that wasn &apos;t a tom .
when i heard that story , it also changed a little bit like i was working and it &apos;s saved me .
and this idea , i saved this idea of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the worst book that ever written .
not just bad , but the worst ever time .
i started thinking , i should just put the project .
but then i remembered it , like tom had been talking about the free sky , and i was trying to .
so i took home my view of the manuscript , and i was talking to my commentary in a empty corner of space .
i &apos;m talking to talk about , <unk> listen , you know , you and i both know , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely guilt , right ?
because you see i &apos;m all i &apos;m going to do . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to follow up and drive your flow .
okay . if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you to the <unk> , i was going to be part of the jobs for my part of the jobs .
because ... -- the end of the end , it &apos;s like following . and centuries ago , in the end , people gathered together with sacred dances and music that were collected for hours -- to dawn .
these are always great , because the dancers were getting professional and they were fantastic .
but over and over again , it &apos;s got very rare , something special . one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen in your life , you know , you know , all in your life .
it was like the time , and the dancers come through a kind of <unk> , he did nothing different than he ever did it , 1,000 nights earlier , but all added .
and all of a sudden , he seemed no longer more human .
it was <unk> from the inside , and it &apos;s <unk> and all <unk> through a <unk> fire .
and when that happened , the people were doing what was that . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> was brought it into the practice of the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> took them into the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you &apos;re still hearing about <unk> and <unk> .
when a physicist in spain had something impossible to do something magic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part of this morning , when the dancers got back in and realize that 11 o &apos;clock is a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s only a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe he &apos;ll never become the same <unk> to climb up .
and maybe you &apos;ll never be able to call the name again , if it &apos;s around , but what is it going to start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> comes in a creative age .
but maybe it &apos;s not to be so full of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning , the most extraordinary aspects of your existence was to be <unk> .
if you may just believe that they &apos;re a loan for a <unk> , a source of a time of your life that &apos;s passed on someone else when they &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking about it , and i think i &apos;m going to work in the book , and it &apos;s soon going to be used to be the dangerous , frightening , frightening , much expected successor to my <unk> success .
what i &apos;m constantly saying to myself when i &apos;m going to be crazy is not fear .
don &apos;t be <unk> .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still going to be there for your contribution , whatever he will be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the silly divine genius that you &apos;re asked to stand on , is you decide to be able to take a sense of wonder through your endeavor , then <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance , they &apos;re your dance .
and <unk> <unk> , <unk> for you , despite all of this .
i believe it , and i feel that we should teach .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , for you , despite all of this , just that you have the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed this two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had fallen for almost three million years of the lower 48 states , to be more stable .
but this isn &apos;t really enough enough to say the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global warming .
it &apos;s been growing in the winter and the summertime .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> which is happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red .
as you see , it grows on the <unk> , and this is the annual ice in the winter ; and it &apos;s pouring in the summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old , is almost like blood <unk> , which is a <unk> here .
in 25 years it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem because the warming of the frozen cause to <unk> the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of <unk> carbon , which is , if it &apos;s going to be <unk> , from microbes to methane .
compared with the entire amount of <unk> , that &apos;s atmosphere , it could double that amount of time when we transcend this critical period .
today , there &apos;s some flat lakes in alaska , methane itself from itself .
professor <unk> &apos;s party in alaska is with another <unk> to another flat lake in winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it be like us .
and one reason is that vast reservoir of heat warming greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but volume are substantially bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest ocean .
if you want to know , like the sea level of <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> into the ocean .
these rivers are taking a mess .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers have recently been that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that came up with a few <unk> , is particularly powerful in the melt .
this is about 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the top of new lakes that were glaciers around a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world receives half of their water in this <unk> .
this glacier is in the andes of this glacier <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s also going to be <unk> <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction reduction in the sierra world .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
this <unk> in the entire world has a dramatic spike on fire .
and the disasters in the world have a really <unk> , and before we have never increased the number of light .
four times as many of the last 30 years , like <unk> <unk> .
this is a fully <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of carbon dioxide , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the ocean .
look at the area of the eastern pacific west , the american continent of western continent , and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most important problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot more .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that have been out in the last few years , with some of the green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last last <unk> to promote clean charcoal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this painting reminded me of something .
around christmas , i went home to tennessee and in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our country &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
this was about christmas .
one of the <unk> the <unk> in the world was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy kid .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> becomes a <unk> cleaner .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> and workers remain into <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me say one of them . al gore , nancy <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance has started to have two education for climate change .
this is one , part of your mind .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious danger of our business .
so we &apos;ve got to the top <unk> , a major <unk> spend to spend a <unk> on the way to get the truth of coal .
the fact is coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s smelling even well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s calm it .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so , let &apos;s go through a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of the coal of one of the main warming is the global warming , the remarkable clean <unk> , which you see here , everything changes .
look at it , this is today &apos;s called clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge for national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all together is our dependence on <unk> fuel , like dirty dirty and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to set us out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years of 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to make ourselves safer and help the global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways of being the dependence on old , dirty fuel that we have , in the world .
the future is here , wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to create good for jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far far , quickly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to the time of your childhood , when they were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to step out and <unk> the <unk> , and move the <unk> and move , they were actually able to think about thinking and problems with understanding and changing the <unk> landscape .
spatial thinking is deeply connected to the most part of our surroundings .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with the real objects -- with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues , i started wondering : what if we could use computers , that would be -- -- what if we could intervene with both two hands and actually take data and so we could imagine how we want to do it ?
and this question was so <unk> that we decided to investigate the answer and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move your hand , you can sense each other , you can capture the movements and you have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , are physically , so you can just reach out how <unk> and access it .
and the <unk> are a kind of new generation of <unk> for the <unk> digital data .
and if these tools are going to become physical and a conscious awareness of your movements , you can recognize each other and the subtleties of our <unk> with you , then we can start to build new and more personalized <unk> .
i start with some simple examples .
this is a <unk> , in the <unk> , and if i <unk> it up in a direction , the video will be going forward , and when i push it down , it &apos;s backward .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other .
so if i put them up , it makes interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that also , and you can get a little bit more nervous .
and they feel also their motions and the tilt .
and an interesting implication of the interactions we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like colors like this to the ocean , like you do this with the fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to put color in the center where they &apos;re mixed mixed .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> a little bit .
there are also some nice ways in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the opportunity to get fast and so that the results will be shown to see .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> attitude .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , every round of <unk> randomly happened to be <unk> letters and while you &apos;re trying to form words , this is a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s pumped again and you have a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab , and i could move them to try and put it on and have video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instruction .
all you have to say is &quot; do words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> , right there right .
it turned out that he was just wanting to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the <unk> from the table that shows this character .
and here he is going to be .
the sun is going to go on .
now he &apos;s got a tractor in the scene .
the orange seal .
good work ! yeah !
by holding the <unk> shake and she can put the characters next to each other , he can make the characters interact ...
... his own story .
hi there !
it &apos;s a story with open and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example that i &apos;ve been doing today is to show you a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve been developing recently and <unk> as notes , like <unk> , bass and <unk> .
each has four different variations on , you can select which you would like to use .
and you can <unk> those notes into the sequence that you can actually put in any patterns .
and you put them up by just a <unk> of a <unk> .
there are effects that are going to change live , like hall and filters .
you put it together with a specific note , and then you get it to the <unk> .
and then the whole effects of the pace and volume that you &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at it .
we start , in which we put the <unk> into two <unk> and <unk> , and put it in a row , and they add a little bit more of the voice .
now , i add a <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do something more about this .
and now i &apos;m just putting the filters with the drums , so i can control the effect of real .
i can speed up the entire sequence by the speed up and the speed up and the speed .
and now i &apos;m just putting the filters with the bass ; it &apos;s more expression .
i can change the sequence as they &apos;re going .
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the hardware , but can improvise , and <unk> it .
and finally , i can go out the whole sequence by looking at the <unk> of the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which is better to fit in how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to give you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways that we &apos;re working in our lab .
the idea i want to leave you with the way to you , is that we are at the cusp of this new generation of <unk> , interaction with digital media , that are bringing information to our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m very excited to talk to you all !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited to be there .
yeah , so , what should be <unk> ?
i have to step back a little bit , and it &apos;s busy <unk> , with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying biology and i &apos;ve been doing biology now for a few years with the <unk> , and i started this , because i just wanted to see a specific way , and it was particularly , and i wanted to do what i was learning in the study of physics .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was curiosity , and i was sort of trying to get closer to the matter , so .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally , biotechnology , everything you count to do , synthetic biology , and so on .
extremely important , now is now important , and much more important is going to be more important in the future .
there &apos;s so these things that are changing the whole <unk> plants on the <unk> .
there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> that tries to make <unk> , so gasoline gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that are totally aware of the everyday , which most people are not aware of , for example , the <unk> , allowing us to wash the laundry with 40 degrees celsius , are also <unk> <unk> .
and the list can continue on endlessly endlessly .
and so from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to go on and further <unk> .
so what is it <unk> ?
most people know that &apos;s <unk> , most people know .
computers , and then it &apos;s always going to be so , in the media , and then they &apos;re going to break out the <unk> somewhere and <unk> data and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a sad thing for the <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t really matter what they actually started , and what it was like .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way , to solve a problem .
and the problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , so it can also be a <unk> , so you can do a <unk> , any kind of <unk> , a question , and how can you make it better or how can you do better .
and it &apos;s been done with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> <unk> , which is going to make all kinds of <unk> things .
and now , you know , in biology , and i want to take this metaphor to get out of synthetic code , that &apos;s a very basic code , which is , it &apos;s not very much like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so real matter is matter and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code and you can also code and you can also be programming , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
it actually didn &apos;t have a <unk> eight really , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is the <unk> of switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now , now , are now members or active people all over the world .
so this is what &apos;s happening , so it &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and <unk> scientists , so they &apos;re dealing with these technologies and questions and creative and to do this creative , because there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all sorts of things .
but it &apos;s always always about finding such a way to have access to the <unk> , so you have a big deal with this .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more such a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to meet and you &apos;re discussing online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of <unk> on the road , and then they &apos;re going to be asked , yes , <unk> questions .
and from these networks that made the entire popular thing , have developed a scene that i want to leave for a moment .
so here in the front of the left , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a school , a private school , a private school , a way where everybody can .
kids , old , all kinds of people go to this , just to just sort of <unk> , they have a lab and look at what can you do when these <unk> .
here on the left is a group in indonesia , <unk> , which is that , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
more than these other , two networks .
and so , in such an artistic aspect of artistic materials and , yes , <unk> , and combine it in a pretty <unk> way .
a group of mine who i &apos;ve been studying a while ago , which is a <unk> , which is what you wanted to learn from college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain this on <unk> , and people try to explain what is unfamiliar .
and i &apos;ve got up on the other image of a lecture in copenhagen in the museum of medicine , in a combination with an exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , this is usually fairly young people , but the only thing that one is actually all the united kingdom is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it and just ask , and you say , okay , so , what do you know what you want to do , you have an interest to put you in this way ?
so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you &apos;re usually understand from a lab is that kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely <unk> , just for <unk> , trained academics with <unk> and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s not necessary because each one every single <unk> has actually has higher technology than most of the <unk> , that &apos;s really that .
and i &apos;m going to be confused of this premise , then , for example , this premise , then , has been trying to be a <unk> <unk> , and then i &apos;m going to have a <unk> , a <unk> and , yeah , so <unk> , and it works by that bacteria .
so each one of which is a microbial <unk> , which he left for too long , has been done before .
and then i tried to roll this out into my lab , and i would just take a bit of <unk> on ebay , and i could have a bit of <unk> analysis , trying to get a <unk> , so the / <unk> <unk> , even to go home .
now , this should not be a joke .
so here &apos;s the picture , in the image , so , in <unk> , so you see this <unk> garage with also <unk> <unk> , so there &apos;s a group of garage with a also <unk> , which is what put in the middle of what was established , and pretty much quite a interesting things , and it &apos;s also pretty interesting things , and i want to do a project in a very short project .
and this is <unk> , which is just mentioned <unk> , which is , this is a kind of <unk> for molecular biology .
and yeah , so you see it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s the way of people who are doing it all over their own , to large , so , to large , the longer , the more <unk> of the <unk> , in <unk> , is already going to work .
but always , the idea of the approach is that it &apos;s easy to stop and available .
the first project we made as an international group , when we were aware of ourselves , we &apos;re really aware of this , and we &apos;re now online , and we &apos;re online , and we know , so the people that are always going to be and over there , and so forth .
and then the <unk> <unk> website was the founder of the founders , and i told us to really meet , and then i &apos;ve been able to make sure , and then has two events organized , one in london , <unk> 10 , and just in the <unk> , in san francisco .
and then , there was also about <unk> , yes , who are we , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our values and what are our responsibilities for us ?
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
this was quite intuitive , so everybody has just so his wishes , his and what it moves , then , then .
and then , i think , well , a whole good code .
and then we don &apos;t have that that , but that &apos;s because , you know , i think it has a lot of good , and people are right there .
and we actually also tried to get it in the academic world , but there somehow isn &apos;t that way .
so i think we &apos;re going to have a step from the <unk> , in the way , is actually a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to make an optical case for some kind of optical <unk> .
this is , if you focus a laser , you can put a <unk> in a room , and then you can put little particles in this focus or in this focus , so that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , so it &apos;s like a <unk> , basically .
and that &apos;s really what it &apos;s done in academic <unk> , and we thought , &quot; <unk> , we might have , you know , we &apos;ve got a webcam , the <unk> , the lens , <unk> , <unk> , you have a microscope that &apos;s blown up the <unk> .
this is what you see .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> laser , and then trying to focus on this camera .
and it &apos;s not been the same time , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of learning about it .
so another project that came out from the french group of paris , that &apos;s been pretty cool .
and it &apos;s so one of you , so a <unk> , so <unk> , or something like that , so he has <unk> <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet , and in the cooperation with the museum , it &apos;s walked in cooperation .
and then you could go into the room , you could put on this chair on this chair , put it in this helmet .
and then they measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought , or as they thought , are different lights in space .
a pretty pretty crappy project was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing that &apos;s from the united states that &apos;s just going to do with this <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about being <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , fragments , to replicate you can make it visible .
so , if i do this , the <unk> , they go , they collect any <unk> , and then they do this kind of <unk> , and then they &apos;re doing this kind of technique , and then they can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this man , so .
and the machines that make this kind of expensive , which is quite expensive to buy the commercially , the cheapest ones go to <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be much more .
so this is just a application of many , that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been doing this , and they &apos;re free , so , <unk> , so we &apos;re doing it , and they &apos;re free to <unk> available hardware , so they &apos;re doing this device , and they &apos;re now having a <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re now now getting into an emergency trial , and they &apos;re now the cheapest vendor of these devices around the world .
i think maybe six hundred dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s now not cheap , but it &apos;s not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely available in a framework where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , it &apos;s my opinion of a very picky hack .
a project i started recently started building a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , it &apos;s like that far , two inches or so .
you &apos;re <unk> <unk> on <unk> and then <unk> into these <unk> , and then i put it on a <unk> and then i put it into the light .
so the device that you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , but it &apos;s like a branch that has looked like this , so a branch that is on , and it &apos;s available to it , and that was the pressure was too high , that &apos;s just broken .
and then i took a <unk> and it &apos;s been in .
a <unk> , if you do that full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s so 40 to <unk> bar on it .
and so you can get up the particles in a lot enough enough and then go in the back .
and the commercial device costs about 50 dollars or something like that , <unk> around the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , and this is , in the moment , the <unk> of the scene is to increase that availability of technology , and also to increase the information and the <unk> that more people can get involved in there .
because as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively <unk> , and also no chance to make it really well .
because if you read just about it , it &apos;s not the same thing that if you did it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it yourself .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make good decisions in society , and can make good decisions in society , you need to have access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and you have to make it and understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> of the <unk> open source and citizen science .
so that &apos;s how you &apos;re able to get a situation to be able to get a situation with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> from the <unk> .
these are the people who are officially officially , they have on the website , <unk> website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and also , interesting is that they are also being in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , there are fewer people , when actually exist .
so i know some of some who don &apos;t have .
and this is just the <unk> , the individual people .
and partly , with these <unk> , these places , they &apos;re going to be there together .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> started .
and so <unk> , so the <unk> , the <unk> , the first <unk> , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good networks on very good , yes , <unk> , who are going across the world .
and we &apos;re hoping that we can also take care of it , and then also as well as well as they are , so that can be more and more .
and i would invite everybody to go and try to try and try to try and try to try .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and enough energy , you get too far .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , yeah , hey .
how do we work ?
this is a question that is very moved to me , but also in the <unk> <unk> and all of things in the field of <unk> .
it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media , so they can use this interactive media , and make it a very <unk> experience .
because i think the interactive media in us <unk> models , so i think that the interactive media of our biology has been in <unk> , and that we just have just been <unk> through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you think you &apos;re supposed to be a <unk> , you know that the one actually is going to be in the future , but actually it &apos;s so that the future is right at us , in our <unk> .
now , what are the most profound models ?
i &apos;ve been writing four <unk> , and i want to explain to you .
<unk> cognitive models , and these are the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
now , the <unk> models of models is that we have basically a natural relationship to the virtuality .
this is basically what i &apos;m looking at is unusual .
and i &apos;m going to go and get into a moment , and i &apos;ll show you that you have a natural relationship with the virtuality .
the second thing is that , since we &apos;ve been doing this <unk> models , we &apos;ve been able to use a very , very <unk> , although we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is about definition , what is the denial of the linearity , and what we say , of course , is that we are feeling as a normal experience .
the fourth point is that history is a place of <unk> .
so , as it &apos;s now with virtuality , which is actually the most basic thing in the world .
i want to show you this .
how many doors have the house that you live in ?
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to be going to be able to answer to me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they <unk> the reality , and it &apos;s all no computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to have trouble at <unk> for example , to show the virtual reality in our engineering process , we can actually show that the whole time .
and this power of this power to <unk> the reality , which have the people in the smallest times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had was her head .
and in this head , the memory is remembered .
and in this head , knowledge and <unk> , and using this virtual images , the imagination , were also passed on .
and so it &apos;s also deeply that we can imagine that we can deal with the virtuality with the virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what &apos;s going .
the interesting thing is that this time of man was at the same time and medium of itself .
now , let &apos;s think about a little bit .
what are the media today ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that it has given a change .
but i &apos;ll get to talk about it again .
the most fundamental tool of <unk> has been history for history .
<unk> , priests , <unk> <unk> , were just going to be willing to know , to maintain knowledge in stories .
and today we are still very , very much about stories .
the author of the book the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still <unk> , we still <unk> the <unk> of stories every year with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a kid that &apos;s been to the end of the most <unk> of the time that most of his life has been living with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love of stories depends on that we &apos;ve been on the lap of our parents &apos; lap .
no , no , far .
this is going to go back and forth in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , for me , in the realm of interactive media , as particularly impressive , is that we have evolved by <unk> in our biology , the ability to think more convenient .
i brought them an example with me from the north american tribe of the <unk> tribe .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate there , from an island to get out of food , to raise food .
and they did this with such a <unk> .
you may have , if you &apos;re a little bit of interest , by the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they have the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of the areas were mapped to be mapped .
and the way that was the language of <unk> <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and over rhythm .
and these sounds and the rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and that of course also means that you could <unk> these songs and put together and put it on the left , and also to move back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing , and we don &apos;t , to get from a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s that <unk> the machine age .
we &apos;ve been called the <unk> in the so-called <unk> .
and it &apos;s happened the age age and it &apos;s happened and it &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the copying of our individual memories of the body .
and it &apos;s in the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , god &apos;s a bit of <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
in virtuality , it &apos;s suddenly alien to become happier for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> at the <unk> , he &apos;s so far to say that this mass media , he &apos;s thinking that this mass media , he &apos;s thinking that this mass media , and so on , what we consider mass media today , and our ability to have <unk> our memories .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the machine age .
what &apos;s influence on our thinking and our <unk> ?
then the most pessimistic <unk> influences in the pre-industrial world .
and they &apos;re going to be more <unk> over the centuries and more <unk> , and they &apos;ve been <unk> by the spirit of the <unk> .
that means instead of remember that we have a lot of common , wide spread , the vast patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we produce more self .
we have an abstract language .
we &apos;re not asking ourselves more in pictures that are not in pictures , but we &apos;re <unk> our language .
we &apos;ve got to do this , things happen .
and we have the linearity of law , and there &apos;s only some exceptions , like the <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve been missing is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re very , very <unk> .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re now going to take this so-called <unk> .
this sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very much like science , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , they bring us to explore these possibilities back back to our capabilities again .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this for a little bit .
there are technological concepts like examples of the <unk> , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google tests for example , then a concept of what is going to combine to the virtual world with the real world , which means our <unk> to <unk> , the virtual normal , is going to be seen .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , this is what i &apos;m like , of course , the way of course of my presentation , &quot; it &apos;s moving us , not <unk> , virtual worlds , to the model of the <unk> .
and other examples of these are <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that are intelligent to people .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept in virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the end , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you can get up a long time , so you can pause in the back with the two things that you have .
and this project i brought to me as an example of how back to this <unk> , cognitive models .
and all the whole thing is to say , i have to say that .
what the <unk> of course of course is extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i &apos;m computer games , you probably have a very likely to be able to see any people who were <unk> , or they &apos;re playing with some <unk> in the hand .
anyway , you do that in the way .
this is a game for out .
and this is what i thought about is that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , which is the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry to be so strong .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more much more behind it .
and it &apos;s about that i &apos;m looking at a city by looking at what places or negative <unk> .
and so i get a whole different view of the city , a whole different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and get this kind of different way , and it &apos;s a very different kind of real city , a different kind of city .
and we &apos;re going to look at this .
ah , what you see here , sorry , is another explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , the virtual world of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to sum up my talk and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;ve been hearing from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;ve been <unk> from the <unk> , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;ve been <unk> from the <unk> , technological , technological , new products don &apos;t actually come back to our origins .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be very much to you .
i &apos;ve been asked , if this bag is a <unk> bag and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;ll also get the same time that &apos;s inside .
but i do so far , just curious about it .
yeah , kids are from <unk> or curious , designers , also .
i &apos;m a creator of the house , so i &apos;m actually involved in the subject of curiosity and how does the curiosity do again , and why are we going to lose curiosity and we need to go back and so forth .
this is a whole bunch of things that you &apos;re trying to do with the actual value of emotions .
if professors are going to be , they &apos;re often going to be in the <unk> &apos; n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had last half year .
a <unk> issue is a <unk> subject .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the way that they &apos;re going to catch up with such natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and there &apos;s one of these little devices high because things are more intuitive , more and more natural , more and more natural , and there you have to look , what is actually , of course , is , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
and before the background , i have a <unk> of the field of design , so the next generation of the <unk> of the human computer in the relationship of the human being computer is how our tools , or how our computers changed the computer , they changed digital assistant .
so i was busy doing this , and of course , when , of course , is a intuitive .
maybe again , maybe a look .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the evolution of our own society , just slide , we &apos;re going to be here , and then we move from the third one to the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so the modern <unk> .
every society is a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> through the language .
that &apos;s what , you &apos;ve found that you could have a language , you could communicate with each other , is to be able to go into the same cave or in other areas , cities , and villages , and they &apos;ve created this <unk> <unk> .
but the language of the time was the language , something very natural , something very living .
and you had to learn that , so no longer , you can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it <unk> and to of course .
that &apos;s then taken away from the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
and this was a <unk> , because you know , the vibrant language began to put into a <unk> in the form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive , i start and <unk> it in stone and i &apos;m going to do it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i &apos;m going to <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story , as if there is a life of a living .
but then <unk> , the writing was actually got to be <unk> .
then the next generation came to the one that we &apos;re actually still alive .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> writing with <unk> and others .
and then , it was just a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other said , you &apos;re actually <unk> , when the people start to read , then the guy is going to be a lot of that , and that &apos;s obviously completely <unk> .
and now we &apos;re coming into the next generation , and i &apos;ve been studying this , so a <unk> is just a hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this <unk> phase that we &apos;re doing this .
and so , the confused of course , of course , totally , because we see on the one side , the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
and the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , what is the old thinking of being <unk> , don &apos;t say that in the <unk> market , no longer is a <unk> , and that &apos;s what i want to do is just just <unk> and want to do it at all .
and these two worlds , they just zip together , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> , very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm out of the <unk> .
but not anymore at the local level , but to global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that &apos;s the topic of ecology , a global issue .
not , if i think locally organic , and the neighbor &apos;s less green , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from local village , actually a global village has become the same principles , of course , in the very least intuitive , but the total transparency .
so , as you were in the village , who was talking about who and when , so this is what happens today today is about this extension of our self through these mobile devices , in global scale .
it &apos;s like we know global warming and faster and more and more .
like the same time , it was just like that was happening .
and the background , i &apos;ve just got to look at this , looking at what &apos;s actually meant for us , of course , which we might have also <unk> , which is , for us , but also , &quot; and then , what makes it difference ?
because often , people are , can &apos;t do it , they can &apos;t do it with anyone so that everyone can do it .
so you have to engage with what is that , and not just simply it change that it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and then , of course , something intuitively , and how i can make a sense of it , and how i make a sense of doing things like a <unk> , so intuitive , because they &apos;re just fun and just using them .
and then you &apos;re doing it as an unexpected subject , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and this is , of course , also , where you start and look like it and it and says , okay , i just look into the inner self .
and how does it look like , actually , in fact ?
so how do we work when we put it out ?
and what does mean , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of cognition and how does the cognitive form work ?
because steve jobs told me to <unk> you <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to make something more or intuitive , and what is that in the core .
and there you have a little bit of our seven senses , most of the minds we have only five , now , is even seven <unk> , because it &apos;s certainly going to be the next to the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of our self .
and to look how process we process information , how do we take information ?
by your own , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , don &apos;t know what it means to be in .
but i have to understand in the core , in the words , to understand information , when is going to be information , from information , and then information that again , i know , as i can also do , i think , is intuitive or <unk> .
and of course , as it &apos;s kind of taking design influence in perception .
so we see this , if i &apos;m designing things , i can make it <unk> , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know , and pepper , or i can kind of like to make it intuitive , i can show things .
so a lot of natural , in a vessel , but i see a kind of direct salt , where is salt and pepper .
and if i &apos;m going to say someone , give me salt or pepper , then he will be able to figure out the right now , where is inside .
and the left is intuitive to me , and hopefully i hope that no sugar in there are , salt , just like that salt .
but also our perception self , how does it take us to us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle is bigger than the small , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just about the same , and yet , our perception of what context is we &apos;re doing things .
does anyone know what that is ?
on the throne .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s a little bit more about my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n of the circle .
a second circle starts to relate to some senses or too .
and then , if i stop a <unk> , we &apos;re not just going to see more , which is , and , and , but , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> , who also has transformed us in perception .
and the creator for designers that have the most of the time , the most of the semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> the continuity and so on .
and often , you know , you &apos;ve got forgotten .
but this is a essential component to be part , if you want to make things like that intuitively , you know .
the next phenomena , which is also very interesting , that &apos;s what &apos;s also interesting .
so , it sounds very trite , but it &apos;s very exciting if you &apos;re busy busy .
so we &apos;re going to the front , and now think , we &apos;re looking at the back of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see , from the back to the front of the back .
and then , you know , <unk> a assumption , you see something you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we only see our vision before we see it , again , again , in our <unk> , <unk> , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got a kind of cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s there , then it comes back .
and then it goes again , because the back is the beginning , because the back is the front and says , now , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you see , what you want to see .
and then it goes back back again , and then it &apos;s really going to be seen .
so a very , very <unk> process , how certain things work , and what &apos;s happening for <unk> these things .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what .
anyone see something ?
a <unk> , right .
once i &apos;ve seen that , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget about it because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , now you see it .
this is , i &apos;ve been doing this in the <unk> <unk> that you don &apos;t recognize any pattern , but i &apos;ve got it <unk> in a very short time , and again , again , this dog in this <unk> image .
and this is this projection , <unk> , vision .
now i know , and i &apos;m now now going to go back to the front of that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , quite exciting processes that then , you know , gray is not actually not gray , but here &apos;s a mass of this kind of <unk> crowd .
does anyone know what three seconds ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds to go from the present into the <unk> , then i can also bridge very well <unk> , where i &apos;m going to do it by someone else with three seconds .
it &apos;s just to digest the present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can make a very elegant <unk> <unk> to be the computer on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what does it take a milliseconds of cards ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love .
that means that if you know that , you know , who you see as long because i don &apos;t take any <unk> for what can happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the era of most of the sensations we have .
that means , this first idea is happening in a rapid speed rate , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking for and how we &apos;re looking for , and how we might have to protect ourselves from our environment so that we can think about it as well .
of course , the designers not just interfere with the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but mostly , of course , with the subject of <unk> .
so , as a human , it &apos;s like some things about .
there &apos;s also <unk> the practical functions , so there &apos;s so <unk> aspects of the <unk> aspects of the <unk> .
there are <unk> , where i &apos;m going to have to reach right where i need to reach .
but there are symbolic functions , why is someone like a little <unk> , where no matter what <unk> , so <unk> money on money , even though it isn &apos;t so practical ?
we &apos;re more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , in the <unk> , which we also have to deal with as designers .
back to my actual theme of natural , interface interface and subject , which is , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means always means how can i get quickly a very basic , or how can a user to achieve a user in a particular <unk> , effective and <unk> .
so , it says , &quot; the norm is more .
how can i make a little bit of <unk> ?
i can &apos;t feed the right or need i do , or i need some <unk> , i need some training for this .
and less <unk> or <unk> .
that i do just make it different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you need to understand that .
and then , if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , and look at it , you &apos;ll also understand why <unk> percent of our universe is very intuitive or not to <unk> , which is <unk> in many areas or <unk> that , although it &apos;s a lot more intuitive than classical software .
and this is an intuitive <unk> not only since apple <unk> <unk> <unk> , if i just want to use technological devices to make people .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re going to be the <unk> , which is , in the rule of the <unk> , which is the natural user , <unk> , for example five times , are on our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural , it &apos;s just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably get four hours more likely to go home , but your family , or anybody &apos;s going to be preoccupied with it , you know , for four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a corresponding time for us to do a corresponding solution to make some of some things .
so if we &apos;re going to go back to software , this is the first <unk> <unk> , which were very abstract , which is very abstract to the time to cope with these systems .
and then the next thing that came from now , which is , you know , the next thing that &apos;s been working with is working on the computer , which is , you have a notion of something that is metaphor to make the metaphor of a desktop to make it available .
so no more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
and that made this whole thing for a lot , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is going to work with behavior very much more .
so i &apos;m designing as a designer , much more likely to behave than that .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that i once in once you get the <unk> for success , the <unk> is going to be a app .
and if i &apos;m going to take a step into this natural user interfaces , where i &apos;m talking about voice , by language , by language , by <unk> , by both of the gesture , and the <unk> , the things have to do , i &apos;m still faster and even .
but that &apos;s also what i &apos;m going back to the point , when are the things that are more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re going to become more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend , and see , which means that , because , what does it mean because of the <unk> , when is it really intuitively , like ?
and that &apos;s always a intuitive thing for us to think about , if i have to think about it .
so it seems to be not like to think , but it &apos;s just to work out .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means if we look at that , we can take some <unk> <unk> from one thing to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do this as a designer .
that means i can just make an intuitive , human <unk> on a software and making the software much more smoothly .
now , of course , the question , of course , what is that most <unk> <unk> of us humans and now have been told .
this is what we call the <unk> .
this is used every of us and <unk> is an acronym and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this is all of you all the time , but it &apos;s unconscious , and it &apos;s like intuitive or partly <unk> .
the model is already being <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s being used by all of us , without the most , that most of the other knew that this model is present .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about fifty to <unk> times from us ever in activity , so it &apos;s been found that they would often drift up as much as a day .
i can now be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher <unk> of the <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m going to find this , for example , i can find out of the detail , and i can see it , and i &apos;m going to look at the detail , and i &apos;m <unk> , &quot; i can &apos;t mean that somewhere or someone else , and you can go and go and down .
then i can translate this all the time .
i try this one by a <unk> .
now , everybody ate already .
in fact , i now use the object , you can <unk> it back .
i &apos;ll get all of the <unk> , and i can say this , and i can say , just for all of the <unk> chocolate .
and on a time , a interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can make things like the bits , <unk> , and they come to me is much more natural than if we can make it available to me , <unk> <unk> , or other mechanisms of making these things available .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i want to close to give a and again the evidence , also , designers need to think differently to come up to new solutions , and in that sense , i want to close them , and please .
i want to help you to help you a specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you get a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re looking at what you feel like , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the <unk> and put it , the more , you know , will be involved in the <unk> and the more curiosity of course .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so , all of these are all the ones that are here and curious about , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now going to go to this , basically , this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , into quality of quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in that .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day they &apos;re going to make a mate , they give you about two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to pick up two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store power .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just do as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t take phosphorus and put it in .
and amazingly , that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about here , and something about what is a <unk> , but not that .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but no one &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got about two years , and already , through the <unk> world , in the world , are being used as much as more uranium in the environment than in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of <unk> tons of <unk> tons of <unk> tons of <unk> tons of <unk> .
and we take it all up .
it &apos;s <unk> in kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little bit less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , get less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
this is not protection .
that &apos;s like i would say , <unk> your child , no three times , 10 times .
it &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire world will be the whole world , or later a <unk> .
so , from the <unk> to think about the <unk> .
and the most important thing is , to look at the ground , the first thing .
in the ground , over <unk> percent of the <unk> .
we &apos;re currently going to build corn and 30 pounds of 30 pounds per hectare per hectare , or on the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing around the ground about five thousand times more than new .
and of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is cool or content .
for example , at the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> are <unk> .
and because we &apos;re getting older , that will be the <unk> bigger .
this is , in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby needs about six thousand <unk> .
we could , of course , to cut 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the proof of the way that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because phosphorus is being <unk> by pigs , which is <unk> .
in the people , the <unk> .
yeah .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening , isn &apos;t it ?
traditionally , we think we think about the <unk> , and we are too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re in the people who are when you &apos;re <unk> the people , if you say that , that would be better , you &apos;re not going to be <unk> and hostile .
and somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing to stabilize human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a live <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> the earth .
here &apos;s the more you say , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites in the united states , but in the united states , they may not have termites in that way , even though they were vegetarians .
that means that ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and because they &apos;re physically working harder than we do , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re living in their weight , in energy consumption , in energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you see , how far we &apos;re going to do and we could really do and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , a program , has a program , to 20 thousand 40 , you want to be <unk> , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yeah ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree ?
yeah ?
one ?
that means that our entire intelligence means that we want to be trees , right ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees alone in the <unk> .
you &apos;ve heard some of the <unk> from trees you &apos;ve heard of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be trees .
and where you see , even in a bit like demeter , the <unk> <unk> , it doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back into the back .
and so many of us are too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you all will , that will allow our own <unk> back .
isn &apos;t that unhappy ?
we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to try and try to make our ecological footprint footprint , but it &apos;s about making a big footprint , it &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there , right ?
<unk> , yeah ?
you can only have <unk> if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were shooting away , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we do it in brazil agriculture , where we get the nutrients back .
and we can actually see that in the way , in agriculture , in agriculture .
we do this in china for example , where we &apos;re going to take the waste away from it .
in china , a <unk> <unk> can still <unk> , so yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb to the nutrients .
this is , the whole western <unk> is that the city has been just to be , but the farmers never have to have .
so that &apos;s how the cities are growing more and more because farmers went into cities , and they had to keep going away and get their nutrients .
so , all of the western empires are always expanding , until they don &apos;t get the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
china was different .
you &apos;ve done a <unk> civilization for five thousand years , because you always have been able to pull the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to lunch in china , you expect to stay for you to stay in the toilet , you know , until you go to the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to go and take the nutrients .
you have invited them to lunch , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see the internet , you can see the nutrients back .
this is actually nice to do this , so , as it does , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s produced by a hectare of <unk> , and it &apos;s produced by a hectare of <unk> dollars to produce a farmer about <unk> dollars and the plant that are waiting , chickens and pig pig and ducks and <unk> and fish .
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas are coming back over <unk> .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people , to be very bad .
we can support them , good .
this is <unk> , of course , but the facilities carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed this way by design , which is a farmer to do .
that means that &apos;s going to go back and forth .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve been built over <unk> built in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been rejected .
you could just be <unk> out of <unk> , and then it would be the plant of the <unk> .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , to be very bad .
we can support them , good .
that means we have to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re going to write , in germany , you &apos;re the best <unk> of all the treatment treatment , in <unk> .
unfortunately , the <unk> , but maybe you can help a little help with this .
because the <unk> plant could be best at phosphorus .
and then it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s been working .
we &apos;ve been deployed in the netherlands for three years .
the dutch government has explained , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that are almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s a bunch of <unk> that &apos;s opec .
these are <unk> countries , which are 40 percent of the u.s. economy .
and the oil is replacing , we can replace other energy .
but phosphorus is not replacing the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about getting the existing problem a little bit less badly , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and , first of all , first of all , to ask questions about what is the right thing .
that &apos;s not about efficiency , not about efficiency .
and in the netherlands , you get easier , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if you &apos;re miserable , if you &apos;re sad , if you have a good job , if you &apos;ve got them <unk> , and you get to get to the occasional of the <unk> .
completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s effective , yeah , right ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six of a second , three pounds of the time in their life .
that &apos;s what you do .
this is not a scientifically science doesn &apos;t not exactly exactly exactly the correct , because because we don &apos;t know how much more <unk> is going to be .
but a <unk> , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s effective , right ?
a thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not about resource , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not , the <unk> <unk> to be a little bit better and put it on it and in the <unk> process all the materials for the environment , but first time , how do you get a trend ?
imagine mozart deeply .
yeah ?
if i <unk> them for dinner and say , yeah , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s effectively efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in love , efficiently ?
yeah ?
that means everything that matters in life , is not to avoid about avoiding it &apos;s not to avoid .
all the <unk> .
we say , oh , you know , you don &apos;t have a green place in the south .
no , it &apos;s throwing the right thing , right ?
every place where you go from , yes , you get <unk> .
but the wrong thing .
if you put things wrong , you have a <unk> .
in how we think from the north .
there &apos;s a footprint in every footprint .
if you walk , yeah , every footprint , every footprint .
because the soil will die and the wind and the water and the water , the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint is , every footprint that is the water that &apos;s going to be in the meadow .
so it &apos;s about creating a big footprint , which is a <unk> <unk> .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re going to go sustainability .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how do you get your wife ?
what do they say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
that &apos;s the minimum .
so not saving , avoid , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a kind of lust when you see in italy , like people in the high bow get out of the car , it &apos;s got to kick out .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but the right design , please .
so , for example , we developed a <unk> , which is a very liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re going across everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they do it through the throwing diversity of diversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so they are two loops .
not all of course , of course , be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they don &apos;t use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to be so that they &apos;re going to go into biological systems .
the things that are only used , go into technical systems .
but today , we just talk about the biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
it &apos;s not direct ad , not for the company in <unk> , but for that , you &apos;re going to help this business , make these products .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore , it &apos;s not .
yeah ?
so , if i &apos;m going to eat it and say , this is free of <unk> , then you don &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can go to the <unk> and the <unk> of the biological circuits , ya ?
everything is <unk> from it .
and if it &apos;s got us , it &apos;s actually given us for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> world that are causing by the textile industry .
so you &apos;re going to help me ask , ask yourself for people .
hey , <unk> , do you really want your really serious ?
because now , you &apos;ve got to change the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure you really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit of this .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been demonstrated .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
we can make things like this , that if you &apos;re <unk> , you can put into biological cycles .
technical reform is just like that .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this .
this is the first green <unk> , actually , in fact , that &apos;s done in the circulation .
also , so that &apos;s what you can do , you can put things in every store .
if you come to that , yeah ?
remember the <unk> of the <unk> ?
if you have the waste .
everywhere , this <unk> , almost .
in the world where people are getting money .
so , on the front burner , but also in the landscape , yeah ?
if we change the plastics , so that if we change the <unk> , we can go to <unk> , and then they can go back to <unk> , they can go back to a baby in israel or in tunisia , <unk> trees .
yeah ?
so , just if you take these <unk> , they <unk> , sterile and the powder so that trees .
so that &apos;s <unk> for the entire life , already from beginning .
so we don &apos;t need <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so , in a way .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent everything .
i &apos;ve started an institute .
now , there &apos;s lots of people there , and they can get involved in all .
there &apos;s an extra group to do , <unk> , where everybody can be .
so not saving , avoid , avoid , avoid , reducing , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you want to do that ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as a language .
so in the description of my speech , i wrote , as a <unk> , i understand as a <unk> , so i understand as a <unk> , so english <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of the written notes in <unk> music .
and as a translator , you don &apos;t just push the text into a different language , but also the deeper appreciation of words and <unk> understand it has to understand a reasonable translation , it knows anyone who has to do with <unk> .
from the german to the english , you can &apos;t take more knowledge , because if you &apos;re talking about poetry or it &apos;s about poetry .
but alien is it &apos;s a bit of a <unk> for <unk> , what we &apos;re doing with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just had the written down to the written .
you think that a composer that has been in the grades just everything he thought of .
in fact , the scores of very selfish and <unk> .
and these notes are about as much as precise or <unk> , like a verbal , albeit a sense of , albeit very , very <unk> , description of a landscape .
because in this nursery , the smell of flowers is not smell , the degree of the <unk> just to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not too .
that means the role of the governance has to translate this <unk> , namely , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
today , i want to show you what i &apos;m going to translate on , so <unk> , even a <unk> language .
so basically , in translation , i &apos;m in translation .
so i prefer to do this whole thing to german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be to <unk> the translation of translation .
so , the music is working for me as much as the spoken word .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
so it &apos;s not going to be just to learn to the piano and the <unk> to the piano or the right place to press on a <unk> .
because that would just be the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters is only when you can get the language .
so you need to be a <unk> learning process at least as long as the spoken word for spoken language .
and then there &apos;s also <unk> whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passively understand or you can also talk to actively speak until the musical speaker .
the <unk> work starts to <unk> like a <unk> .
after you start to play a piece , you &apos;re excited about , because you &apos;re excited about , you &apos;re looking for a different part of the creation of composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers .
you studied the works that he was previously and <unk> .
you think about it .
the <unk> , it &apos;s to write .
how and what does he feel ?
how were his life , how the society and politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you think about this time in , you know , you read the <unk> images of looking at the same time .
but with the time , however , you have a rich knowledge to composers around the composers that you &apos;re playing over and it &apos;s getting easier to feel easier to <unk> and feel .
the composer is always being more and more to the friend you live with .
and the cause to write the piece is going to be more and more and more to my personal concerns .
now , the grades are all the same record of the cause of the composer of composers , but just a framework , i turn this scaffold into a sense of meaning and meaning to <unk> .
and i &apos;ll tell my own words , what was written between this framework .
i &apos;m playing <unk> , which may have these sounds .
now for me and for the composer , and what you might mean for him today .
every note , every phrase is a sense , because i feel it myself because it comes from my now personally <unk> .
it has to be in this and now <unk> , i can &apos;t convince my audience to you that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve done so long in advance , and to experience how new .
how you experienced a happy new day again , even though , even with the same rituals of life , get up , eating your work , so as i &apos;ve ever seen the same piece over again , again , to the same .
i grew up a day , the seasons grew , my pulse is <unk> down , and it &apos;s going to slow back in a <unk> , it takes longer that sound back to return to home .
i &apos;m going to take the audience to breathe in the audience , you know , or <unk> .
all that influenced me and all that affects my experience with the composition .
so , quite wonderful , if i stand with a <unk> on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea , and i &apos;m going to get this answer to a response .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we don &apos;t have and what you &apos;re not about is so that .
it &apos;s great fun to make music , and you have experienced the audience , as the audience is communicating with .
this is a different concert of concert every concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like this , as in this moment .
i can &apos;t play this today as 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and so my <unk> of <unk> are still much more <unk> , more emotions and feeling than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but for that , for that , it &apos;s new <unk> .
so , a nice example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> and a professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young so that he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was fortunate enough to meet it very early , and i was able to meet my school classes .
i was 17 , when i was on one of his courses , and i was playing the last <unk> of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
and he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> for me .
this is so a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , is expectation .
and he was <unk> , and he said , so ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was already <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not a significant memories .
i play the piece today , and i &apos;ve always been able to get it to me , although no one has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m going to read something new .
so one example of this is a very different field , the phenomenon has made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , in <unk> light .
he has translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as she looked at this moment , as you did .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is like that .
now , i &apos;ve been older than the chopin with a <unk> , when he wrote the piece .
he was lived only for a second .
and it &apos;s important to me , and i &apos;m going to go back to the notes , even if i mean , i think it &apos;s too .
to keep <unk> , right with the composer .
because the grades are the only connection to him .
especially if he died already .
now , how do you start talking the language of music ?
i &apos;ve been saying yes , you need for about the spoken word .
and so often the <unk> is that you learn to read the music .
you &apos;re just learning that before you &apos;re talking about just a word .
you learn to find the sounds on the <unk> .
if all the fingers in time and it &apos;s really right as it moves in the front door , then sound that sound together like music .
if that &apos;s happening , the students will get the <unk> off .
the interpretation is almost in the <unk> .
all right , so there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
it &apos;s noisy and <unk> , and b , etc .
you know , most of this .
but even though you &apos;re installing these data , it &apos;s still a little technical technology .
and it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder you often forget about a very <unk> .
namely , that , to make music on the instrument , your musical <unk> and feel even there before .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re singing .
a child that doesn &apos;t learn that , because it &apos;s not been <unk> , it &apos;s not going to do it .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and the idea of music , then it &apos;s about another possibility , so to get a sound tool .
people who never meant that they have never been <unk> with their own body , as it is to form a note .
a phrase to your own breath .
the instrument is that &apos;s extension of our body .
our vocal chords , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano is my fingers my fingers .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make more even more yourself , if it &apos;s going to be boring .
no more necessary to whistle a <unk> whistle or to sing .
each of your own music is going to be <unk> when you &apos;re constantly <unk> from the outside of music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yeah , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i mean , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
and it &apos;s not too late to start to find if you can &apos;t yet , or learn how you &apos;re using this little muscle that uses the vocal chords , right right .
and you can train that .
or c , because you &apos;ve got them to <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
i wonder how <unk> was this diagnosis ?
have you ever been told a <unk> or a <unk> , how do you say this today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to have a chance to do with it .
but what i would do regret is because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also even have a <unk> .
well , so you see , you have to see , all of the time , no one has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t you mind , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , you can say , you can say it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s somebody saying , i don &apos;t really appreciate whether it &apos;s because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t get rid of food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to be <unk> , they don &apos;t have to be able to get an instrument , because they &apos;re not going to play instrument .
listen consciously , and they say it tastes or not .
whether the music to be too sweet or sweet .
tell what you &apos;re feeling .
and then you get a little bit more spices with the time , and you want to taste some spices out there , or taste <unk> .
why am i asking from my audience now , that it &apos;s also actively listening ?
because music is a language , and language is to communicate .
a piece of art that you never look at , has no force to act .
the food that was being boiled from a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> needs to be eaten and just looked at the <unk> or recipes .
so you listen to you , if a music is being played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a facility where the adults are going to make music , or at least at least , to be active at least , a child , a child , it &apos;s easy to be a <unk> , asking what color is in ?
can you also be playing in blue now ?
and the kid plays a <unk> , and instead of a blue flower , it &apos;s a blue flower .
and this sounds different from before .
and that was the first beginning of a personal <unk> of music .
so the first step is to take an interpretation .
and what happens if you play a piece of today , which is originally written by a hundred ago ago , or three hundred years ago , was written in .
meanwhile , the instruments are <unk> .
there was a time when we don &apos;t have the piano at all .
it was just not invented .
i think that the stream was that if he had to have the <unk> opportunity to have had the <unk> opportunity .
i can now <unk> the <unk> that the stream has had to sound in the modern wing to sound what a <unk> can &apos;t do .
and also by beethoven knows , he was more hearing than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play anything , which was a orchestra that was considered as a <unk> .
so the composer rely on us to <unk> the pieces back again .
so they &apos;ll be <unk> , which they &apos;ve been thought of just in the mind .
and also , what you would think today .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is , because what you might expect .
thank you .
do you know what is envy ?
were you ever going to have ?
and how did it feel like ?
<unk> .
i have a friend , the driving a <unk> .
if i come to my little <unk> <unk> and i &apos;m going to go next to this feeling , this feeling .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to do ?
that &apos;s the first year of its own year .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to do it for me so ?
and then i &apos;ll have a bit of a sense of it immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say , &quot; justice , this is an uncomfortable feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to get these instinctive emotions like envy just to disappear .
they can also try to try and do it with words like revenge or <unk> or something .
i want to talk to you with this mechanism today , or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with is .
the mechanism was from the lie .
but think about the lie , as you may have heard , if people say , no one has to build a wall .
and then stones <unk> , so he &apos;s going to tell you the point of view .
and one of the lie in a lie , you can &apos;t believe that the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying .
it makes <unk> light , it &apos;s very easy to make sense .
he &apos;s just not sure it and not .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , who &apos;s got to do with it , that you &apos;re deceived .
they need this lie to get a <unk> <unk> to get a <unk> .
they can get less easy , yes , <unk> or even collapse .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote you might know .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman &apos;s been <unk> .
this woman has covered <unk> , the portrait would not see .
picasso says , wait just wait .
it &apos;s always going to be more like that .
and if you laugh , you realize how important that lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists really can say to us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist shares something with , and in all of this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you just look into the mirror .
the artist is also split to you in a kind of portrait , which you &apos;ll just be familiar with , if you &apos;re going to look at this piece of work over again .
then this uncomfortable feeling , it might not look like you see , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar to you .
here &apos;s what they have done with the lie to be able to use a great invention to use the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in art , even in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it comes back to .
you may know this idea of the lady , who looked in the mirror , and asked him , who is , the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror , yeah , there &apos;s a <unk> .
and then , behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true bias , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that true versus comes .
but we should just be familiar with that , you know , you can &apos;t tell a woman there &apos;s a way to be there .
here &apos;s reversing that , and what we &apos;re seeing with <unk> <unk> , you know , again .
we need to this point that we have this lie that we can &apos;t even live with .
we don &apos;t just have art in the <unk> , but also in science that great lie .
and there &apos;s this story about the woman of the <unk> of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the origin of humans .
that the person of the apes should <unk> and , yes , at least a common ancestor , between humans and apes .
and then she ran to her husband and said , well , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s true what charles da .
the human being supposed to be in the monkey <unk> or a common ancestor .
no , no , no , no .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to stop that people would have to know about it .
why do we need to avoid that people &apos;s knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ?
because we don &apos;t have these <unk> <unk> .
because we &apos;re having this <unk> , this feeling , being great , <unk> , from one organism , not from one organism that exists , and it &apos;s still exists , and anything else that &apos;s being <unk> for us .
so , we cannot bear those things .
we need to avoid that people are experiencing about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see , how slowly this mechanism is going to be toast , and how the traces of the leave that is going to take something else to the great image of ourselves , i want to see another story .
a particularly beautiful story i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from one day of school , she &apos;s a teacher and she told me about a student .
a 16-year-old student .
she likes to be very happy because he &apos;s a slope toward <unk> .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it already if you &apos;re in this place , there &apos;s nothing wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a person in a moral sense , the <unk> because , should we try and replace it with the <unk> .
and then do this one , and then you experience the sentence .
and even though i &apos;m a fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the rest .
so a little <unk> , that &apos;s not interested in the <unk> .
this is what interests for the <unk> .
but there are no <unk> , where we can look at the way to look at the way you make fire .
there &apos;s only the second second second , the fire fire .
he was signed up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t say that your teacher is like to put fire somewhere and you &apos;re going to be happy when the fire came out of the chicken .
no , it looks just a lot better than we &apos;re showing that we &apos;re going to avoid the dangers that others would only make if they put fire .
this is what they have this little mechanism .
this is this <unk> that he knows the <unk> , which is , in the <unk> , that he actually knows the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious of the <unk> that you &apos;re immediately doing , and the conscious of the things that you know is that you &apos;re going to look very different , so that you can do a lot better for you and can be sound .
so we just get the words that we &apos;re using in the language of the politically , <unk> speech .
we actually know something else is the case .
but we know when we &apos;re going to do that , are the social pathways are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that is supposed to work .
i want to now now , now , what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
and what &apos;s kind of a deception , these <unk> , the willingness to be a different reality , and that we actually know , in the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
i want to present to you two , maybe three examples .
so the first example is what a lot of you know and you appreciate , and some of you , really few just don &apos;t need .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so little intellectual , it &apos;s been like leibniz .
it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t from stop <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people who have a soul , or you can say that , you know , that &apos;s what you have to have a soul , or you can also say that the soul had been given to life , or you can also say that the soul had to be <unk> by you , and blood , something that is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dead .
and then the soul , you know , you &apos;re kind of like this , in this <unk> nature , <unk> , <unk> , in the latin , it &apos;s in the latin , the <unk> , your present .
and if that <unk> is then <unk> over the people , it filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , right with the soul .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so you &apos;re supposed to get from the outside to the people .
so we should perceive them as something that is necessarily to present our lives .
and if you have this mortar eyes , you understand the logic , which we experience happiness through a lie to make a better world .
because now you can use a <unk> .
<unk> still , you know from school .
now this is a <unk> which describes the logic .
this is the way the hardest part of my talk is .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
and that &apos;s like to lie that they can simply use this logic .
in this <unk> , three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , it &apos;s not a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i just pointed out to it , especially .
and the third sentence that immediately comes up with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the saying that who doesn &apos;t have a soul that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t be anything .
and here &apos;s what &apos;s already .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yeah , in this <unk> talk , expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical correct .
i can argue anything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s true .
i can argue anything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just true .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our conscious minds immediately , you can make a little bit of it .
it &apos;s going to depend on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and that &apos;s what it would be the opposite of the first sentence , already , <unk> and <unk> .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses that you &apos;re correct , and a third <unk> , that looks like this , he would have to save our lives with it .
so , we pretend it &apos;s impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can keep these things to different examples .
so in the present , we have a fully modern sample that &apos;s always fed up the <unk> .
and this is another <unk> subject , a <unk> from philosophy , your mind .
so that &apos;s what we do , back in the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> who was johannes <unk> , and after that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> named named <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that is made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you put the exact right in the middle of the middle of the two <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a heck he should go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so , the <unk> is introduced .
<unk> forces , they &apos;re going to solve each other .
nothing happens at all .
so just if you take another example , so if you make a damn bigger , you don &apos;t need to reason it , and it doesn &apos;t even need any reason .
he &apos;s automatically running on the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of being driven in nature , <unk> , from the larger pile that would be dressed , you also have to put it up , you also have to feel like a free will .
and if we &apos;re also in <unk> , and then i remember the <unk> for brain in the field .
there &apos;s a <unk> who is called the wolf <unk> , and he tells him , &quot; <unk> said , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can create the second set and say , if the wolf <unk> has right , it &apos;s not <unk> .
those sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read almost daily in the daily daily , you find that in this third sentence .
this is something that looks like , who has no <unk> , can &apos;t be made for his actions and claims of the <unk> , and it &apos;s so <unk> .
and here you have .
in fact , you have to prove if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so much of the first sentence was wrong , and it &apos;s been wrong , of course , for granted , without evidence .
and now you can just do if you want anything to do anything , if you want something to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that guts to practice at a lie .
practice that , for example , if you encounter a person that you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
you can &apos;t call them , that would be a little bit politically <unk> .
they say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll be one of the ones that you have , for example , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you have a problem .
because whilst they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they cannot prove that there is no <unk> , the man is quite happy .
he &apos;s happy about this because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has led to a <unk> , he &apos;s not <unk> himself .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in the need of itself to prove to prove to prove to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the way of the <unk> , they &apos;re going to experience the brilliance of the lie .
and once you have a way to feel that <unk> , in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy if you don &apos;t remember your <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed me to have a <unk> asked if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the most promising show here from this great event , and asked me if i wanted to hold a talk , and my idea of a way .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , it seemed to be hard to talk about my idea .
and i may , perhaps my favorite day i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of the sum , of many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s been part of this bad girl , because i &apos;ve probably been involved in the generation of engineering engineering , and i &apos;ve been speaking to study engineering , engineering , engineering , today , i think it &apos;s a business .
and i went out the mid- &apos; 80s , and went to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have it .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> , including the <unk> was called <unk> .
the hot <unk> .
because a good engineer has either been built to a great <unk> or <unk> .
but something like that kind of <unk> like the n <unk> , where you sort of a hundred watts of the square <unk> comes out , that was a toy toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful to the <unk> that he had to be <unk> the word again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word at all , because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t the most <unk> years .
and it was like that there was <unk> <unk> and one of them sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you might expect evil .
the <unk> , but that was called <unk> and has wind and solar power and there i started in the middle of the 80s .
and yeah , much of what i &apos;ve been told today , touch me , because many , many nice expressions of the world i &apos;ve been through .
i was working on the collective 11 years , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if no , the <unk> , i &apos;ve been a very <unk> for 10 years , i think , i think , i might have a really hard thing to do , because all the colleagues of my father &apos;s father had always <unk> the money for the window to do it with your child .
it &apos;s busy with insanity .
and this was really very , very <unk> , and you get this image of <unk> where i &apos;ve been asked to be a <unk> , thousand years , a thousand <unk> , and then you were still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the collective of course , whether that &apos;s really the great thing to be .
and i then went from it to <unk> <unk> , and then we have become a <unk> <unk> of the company , then they had become the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s largest <unk> .
a <unk> , a small group , decided we &apos;ve gone back and forth to the next topic of the future , and it &apos;s just crazy , and it &apos;s just crazy , and it &apos;s just crazy , and it starts again , that starts to say , people say , what &apos;s wrong , it &apos;s not , we &apos;re talking about .
and i brought you a project i &apos;ve brought you to you , which i want to show you .
and the title of the presentation was , yes , as you get 100 percent renewable .
and we just have a relatively <unk> story , where could you make a memory of your mind today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have today a renewable savings rate of fifteen percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it just isn &apos;t technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> each other , the system of fail .
i &apos;m also going to tell the politicians , when they &apos;re in <unk> our plant plant .
they always say why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but isn &apos;t that we have seven percent in europe , and our net is the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , the figures that was <unk> , the first one of the islands , but just by doing , but just by .
how big , because it &apos;s been a battery that you have to be a island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back to a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this .
by the way , a year , about a hundred <unk> electric performance on the world .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> in the world , it &apos;s going to be <unk> by contracting , because you have no permission to use it .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
you put it in a way .
and then it looks like this .
and in the end three of the <unk> , two are always waited .
yeah , so it &apos;s a little down there , you see that &apos;s load .
we also have a very detailed data .
and the <unk> or whatever it is , whatever it is , is the rule of a <unk> system , or a system , which is only in small amounts of levels of it .
and our goal was just to say , okay .
the petrol is <unk> and the wind , sun <unk> the load so that they can map bigger levels .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance , you have to cut the reduction off .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be concerned about this , that the renewables are going to take the entire net over the entire net .
and , of course , you can only do , if you &apos;re going to be here in some kind of time .
this is not something that &apos;s happening before .
so , that &apos;s a little bit of a little bit , so you can use your <unk> to your <unk> over a little bit of <unk> .
people always ask me what was going to do , and they &apos;re actually going to <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
but if you want to make a few of these <unk> , and you should build a network , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to <unk> , and then there &apos;s this rest of this rest , the last one that &apos;s last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which becomes very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you do it for batteries .
it &apos;s going to be a competitive system , then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you or <unk> , that will be .
you then have to go to a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s because of a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far does you get ?
and then you have a whole bunch of simulation .
and the burden of <unk> and the burden of the end and the burden of <unk> and came to the conclusion , a very interesting outcome that you &apos;re going to have a <unk> to the <unk> system , which takes about 50 cents a <unk> , about <unk> cents .
this was the first calculation of six years ago .
and then we said okay .
so , yeah , we have a business model .
we are cheaper , like the <unk> , if the average five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would it have to be done ?
have a new <unk> with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new <unk> .
we were only five people in order to rebuild a <unk> to the society .
and here &apos;s the slide .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
and that also has a <unk> system , because we &apos;re still twenty percent of petrol , and also a <unk> <unk> on the other things that are not <unk> .
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island , has been , we find that great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we sort of , the electrical <unk> of the island of the island of the island , one of the island of one , just to be able to happen .
that means we looked for the first building of the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in which case from japan .
and <unk> , they went to the &apos; 70s , and they were developed in the <unk> , and then became <unk> at the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a power of power and can bring six hours of this power , and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as it says there , in the hall , in fact , it &apos;s kind of like this , so that &apos;s the inside of this , so it &apos;s like this , because the air is the light , here &apos;s the big <unk> , here &apos;s the whole <unk> of the <unk> that we simulate the net .
over here , we &apos;re going over here , the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to represent the <unk> in the net .
and you can see this again .
we also can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
so again , we see this again , again , again , again , again , the whole <unk> .
and what we did since the <unk> was the hall in the <unk> , and now , <unk> , all of the things that are here between the individual system of electronics that was built on software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a <unk> , so we &apos;re not defining the <unk> , but we &apos;re also defining ourselves as a company , which is the subject of the battery and the subject of the subject and everything in between .
you need to communicate to the battery , you need to communicate in the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty of the issue that you &apos;re basically on this island today is that you can get all the time of the <unk> on solving problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewable .
so this whole discussion , as it &apos;s going to go back and forth , <unk> , like that , on the island , we have <unk> , for example , to 30 percent of <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> offers to be <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can already start to manage the island already , to cope with <unk> , you can also manage the load .
that is , if you &apos;re renewable , you won &apos;t do that without memory .
you can &apos;t <unk> through n &apos; n , you can &apos;t do the bed nets , yes , you should do , you should have the <unk> , you know , you &apos;re never going to get the <unk> .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
so many people are also going to see , and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the gas , you don &apos;t have a very strong set of mass that causes some kind of more elegant to the grid .
and our <unk> <unk> is just out of <unk> mixed by <unk> , where the wave are around all over europe , is just like that .
we look into this web , see the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s <unk> , we &apos;re going to start a few <unk> <unk> , then you get a little bit off , and then we get back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
if you &apos;re going to sleep this somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time they can react to other people .
if you don &apos;t have that , that &apos;s a rotating mass , then you have to replace this with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can do two milliseconds of <unk> with this big battery .
you already see there &apos;s enormous <unk> there .
and the message is , we have to have to pull out of these rotating <unk> , and if we want to achieve our goals 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to achieve .
then we have to break our <unk> capacity in the net .
<unk> is just called the power station to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t have otherwise , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can break the capacity , the <unk> capacity , can break down , by using a <unk> storage to the grid .
now , there &apos;s also been a lot of studies now .
and this is the purpose of the people and looking at our <unk> on the way , sort of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you go there a little bit of future there .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years , in the last 30 years .
don &apos;t do , we have a <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve never been seeing anything .
we have now <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of that , that we &apos;ve just got the same capacity in <unk> <unk> in the world .
just simply , it will come .
there &apos;s so a whole bunch of <unk> there and debates .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve been seeing this in the last two years , that scientists are asking themselves to my side .
we &apos;ve now got 10 million prescriptions of <unk> , and also , again , <unk> on german web .
this is going to be a big place in the next april .
so , you know , you know , there &apos;s a change that &apos;s happening there and just from that <unk> to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in discussions , these <unk> , they &apos;re doing , they have a little net , they have a little net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is just simply , if you totally make yourself feel like , or <unk> <unk> , who are going to be <unk> somewhere in the world and become <unk> , you &apos;re an island .
then they just use that , and wind and wind is there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said , &quot; energy power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and it &apos;s as it &apos;s so , and the talk of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that you can be a collective , and use solar power , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you to just encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy and also have to have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty much <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , <unk> , in los angeles times , one day , through the streets of los angeles , he was a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , homeless , who played a violin , just two strings .
many of you will know the story , because of <unk> articles on this , it was a book that was <unk> with robert <unk> <unk> with robert <unk> <unk> , and jamie <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who was the <unk> institute who was working with the very <unk> and he was going to end up with his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you to read the movie , to read the movie , so you can understand the movie that you &apos;re going to do , but how the music helped the music helped and how it ultimately made the instrument that it was like , when this rotates is to get the <unk> , <unk> out of the road .
i saw mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to me .
he spoke to a very <unk> and <unk> note about <unk> <unk> and the hillary , as the dodgers never would do it into the baseball world , and all of this because of the <unk> passage of the first <unk> , in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
we came to talk to the issue of music , and a few days later i got an email , where he was , &quot; <unk> &quot; for <unk> for me was interested .
i have to say , nathaniel &apos;s got to say , &quot; a medical treatment , because it was already with electric <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been to his entire life .
as a result , he &apos;s especially susceptible to these schizophrenics , and they &apos;re so bad , and it &apos;s disappearing days , and it &apos;s disappearing for days , in the streets of <unk> row , and this horror and the <unk> of his own minds .
and in exactly the same way , <unk> was nathaniel , when we first approached our first class in walt disney <unk> hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible cattle and smoke and about how to poison him in their sleep .
i was afraid , i could lose it , i could lose it , but i was afraid that i could lose him to be able to destroy his relationship with <unk> , if i started talking about scale scales and other exciting kinds of exciting things .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven <unk> .
and while i played , i noticed that in <unk> , a total change was going to change .
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible medicine , a chemical reaction that was his game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding a calm curiosity and a <unk> .
and how through a miracle took his violin , and began to hear some snippets from <unk> and asked me to play it , to finish it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , starting by bach &apos;s beethoven , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he owned not only a <unk> knowledge about music , but it &apos;s also with a very rigid relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and understanding that i just knew from my colleagues in the township of los angeles .
by playing music , and he talked about music , was <unk> from this <unk> , <unk> man who was just pulled out of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , fine , in <unk> <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
<unk> means music is a great health .
because music allows him to think of his thoughts and delusions with its imagination and creativity in something real <unk> .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that exactly the nature of art is .
so this is why we make music , so we do something that &apos;s going to be in us all , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our own creativity , through our creativity .
and the reality that is really about is all of that , all of us , and move , inspired and <unk> .
what nathaniel did last , so it brought back to the music in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought back into a family of musicians that had the talent and it <unk> .
and i &apos;m always going to be with nathaniel making , whether to be a <unk> disney <unk> hall or <unk> row , because he reminds me why i grew up .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert <unk> : i want to play something i stole the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish .
i just loved two .
this first one was more like a passionate piece .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was <unk> to highest <unk> of the <unk> of sustainability .
so you can think about it , you could feel that you could sell it .
i had this beauty a relationship with a couple of months .
one day the head of the company called the head of the company , and asked if i could come up with an event , could be about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable might have become for our cooks , how do we keep living fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years we have been fished by the ocean as we &apos;ve been bare .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think , or bad <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
many people are against it . <unk> the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a <unk> .
not very sustainable .
taste very well .
so here , finally , a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported her .
and the day before the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s see him .
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for this , so far outside the ocean , that you don &apos;t have <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is going to spread from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> , one , great .
&quot; <unk> one thing ? what does it feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; wow , &quot; i said . put on .
and i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what kind of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he couldn &apos;t . he &apos;s going to be a chance .
now , i &apos;m going to put some people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally <unk> the senior <unk> of the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it the idea .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are the sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
the assumption maybe two percent .
&quot; well , this is about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable to feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken around the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to <unk> me from this fish .
no , no , because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i &apos;m even even .
no , i &apos;ve actually cracked <unk> from this fish because , i swear to god , the fish after this conversation , it &apos;s been pushed chicken .
this second fish is a different kind of love of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you ever learn to fish , you love fish more .
i ate it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s got us a <unk> <unk> .
he came up with a bright , almost <unk> white colors .
the chef had it <unk> .
you know .
astonishingly , it was still <unk> .
who can taste this as good as he was <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s <unk> .
and no , he has no fish , not cooked , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least , the way you and i understand underneath .
he &apos;s a biologist , <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
and then , in the 1980s , the farm was going to be in the <unk> .
they grew <unk> on what &apos;s basically wetlands .
they did this by turning the country .
they built this complicated suite of channels , and they kept <unk> water out of the country and out there in the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make it that the baby , not economic .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds in this place .
and so , 1982 , a spanish company , they bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water in the stream .
they literally have the lever .
instead of the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water back .
they &apos;re <unk> the canals .
they created a <unk> acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and his company , <unk> and his company , the green destruction of the vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you just stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and this density , lush , march .
i was not there long ago at all .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part &quot; a crocodile to rock . &quot;
okay ? so there we were , and we fought the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up to my knees and <unk> <unk> .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
now , he talked about <unk> the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of bundle that &apos;s spun down the <unk> <unk> .
it turns out that <unk> national park has spent the largest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he &apos;s become so a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for connection . &quot;
and then it goes and <unk> <unk> into more <unk> birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , so in the way that way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak , and my head was <unk> , and i had some <unk> fish that i had to <unk> .
so i cut it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it take as good as your fish ? &quot;
he pointed out the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes to me to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed it ?
and i was driving on this site with <unk> , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so , unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you make success ? &quot;
the moment it was like a director had a <unk> charge .
and we bow around the corner , and we offered to have the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of paralysis , literally buddha roosevelt &apos;s been expanding the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you feed your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year , on this site , over 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now becoming the largest and the most important private enterprise in europe today .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing you want to have to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re making <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the buddha so the gut the gut the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s <unk> this . a farm that is not free to it and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> of the first thing wasn &apos;t even there .
they breed in a city of the miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , they fly <unk> miles to the farm .
and every night , they fly <unk> kilometers .
they do this because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i &apos;ve been introduced to a journey of penguins , so i looked at the <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly <unk> miles to the farm and then you fly back to the <unk> of the farm , and then you go back to the last mile ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as i was going to be a song from the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i never cook by cooking .
and yet , when i tried to put it in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t mess it up .
she liked sweet and pure as if you take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned the <unk> and he &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something in the body .
it &apos;s been evolving throughout the evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that is not feeding the fish , a farm that is going to be successful on success .
and then i realized , if he says a farm that has no <unk> , <unk> <unk> , because the water that flows through this farm is coming in from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all of the things that are rivers of the rivers are tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , <unk> from <unk> .
and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and this leaves is the water clean than it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only one farm that you can &apos;t feed the animals not just a farm that measures its success to the health of predators , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , and not just for those fishes , but for you and me .
because if the water goes , it &apos;s <unk> , in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love love , as romantic as is , is also <unk> .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is radical new concept , from agriculture , from one in which food is good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit to radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re doomed .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about food . we eat organic food .
and if you claim that the things are the things that makes good food , you know , someone else in and says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , no , because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are hungry today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;ve been the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
<unk> <unk> , chemicals on earth , <unk> of fish , <unk> the earth , and all the time that agribusiness was saying , &quot; if we were getting cheaper , we can &apos;t feed more people , like that might be like ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the easy place . it was the business business business business .
we should call them what she is , a <unk> in <unk> , a textile that is very quick to <unk> capital of <unk> that will allow you to do that .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened by <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> , not through <unk> water , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but by forests , and not through <unk> and nets , it &apos;s through fish .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that can empower any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never produced something really good to eat .
let &apos;s look at the green model .
this is that , in two billion years , <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
and these are the ones that are trying to be set for themselves , they are <unk> , they &apos;re trying to restore school , they &apos;re trying to grow up , and they &apos;re <unk> instead of just intense , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also being experts .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m going to be .
you know , that &apos;s what &apos;s right to me , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s delicious .
thank you .
if i want to see one of the data that we consume , greater than the sum of their parts and rather than thinking about it , i want to think that you think about how we can use information that , and instead of seeing the trends that otherwise couldn &apos;t be visible .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> tube to be used to age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter out of a particular cause of death , we say , we &apos;re going to accidents .
and i &apos;m immediately seeing a pattern of different patterns that makes it .
and that &apos;s because , in the <unk> , here &apos;s the people who are most active and they &apos;re over there on the top .
we can go out a step further and then line the data and see the data , and see that <unk> and cancer are suspects , but not for everybody .
now if we go on and go to age , we say 40 years or we &apos;re younger , we &apos;re seeing accidents that are the main key to worry about people .
and who &apos;s <unk> , that &apos;s especially in men .
so you can see that this is the look at information and data in this kind of <unk> <unk> .
and if we can make this for data , why not for content ?
so what we &apos;re here is the <unk> of every single person &apos;s sport called <unk> , who were ever printed printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can &apos;t test it for my talk to my <unk> .
with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a specific year .
you can jump directly to a certain kind of issue .
now , if i look at this , i see the athlete i appear to this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance lance , so i click this here , and i &apos;ve been mentioned to my own <unk> armstrong .
now , if i want to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything about the subject ? &quot;
so i go to a step and get the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you &apos;re going to go to this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to be a <unk> or not just <unk> .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to do this idea a little bit more than a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single <unk> and cut them on a little summary .
and then , the end contains a quick picture and a symbol of that coming from it .
i just show the top 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
and i &apos;m going to get a sense of the issues that are the most pressing wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of governance .
well , after i first elected the government , i realize that the <unk> that most of the time is <unk> for time &quot; people of year &quot;
this is really important , because this is a knowledge that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
this is just to recognize if you step back and look at the entire thing .
and then , on a certain one of these dishes , i can then go into the subject of <unk> &quot; people of the year &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of these are <unk> , some come from science , some of the science , and there &apos;s a little less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , the bono also is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re going to try the first time as if it really is a grid , not just from side to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else is a surprise that could be .
i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at the websites so -- and we put these <unk> into each <unk> like this .
so i can go back a step , and just jump to a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s why , because you just look at the same thing from these sites , and in this way , all the <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in my process in a particular field of space .
here &apos;s the one that was the entire demonstration i &apos;ve been given to this .
and i can sort of like anything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and if i take a step back and look at everything , i can actually put my measurements back to my <unk> , and here i &apos;ve been looking for &apos; <unk> , and here &apos;s a live area of <unk> , or here &apos;s <unk> .
and from here , i can go into the page and go to them again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that will be used over again and every time it makes the big bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
at the moment , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and make the internet on the head so that instead of being able to go from one to another , start by many things , and so that we can see patterns that would be hidden hidden from the other ?
if we can do this , then this will be the past <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we learn about , maybe even more knowledge of it , we can even make it away .
so i &apos;m hearing , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus , every day an hour , an hour .
and my nose always bought in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in other worlds and <unk> and <unk> my thoughts in my mind , rotten <unk> , <unk> .
and this curiosity was also that i always was in school , i was not going to school , and i was walking around and went through the forests , and i collected and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s brought home and looked at the microscope .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
it &apos;s always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be in my neighborhood , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of miracles that we never could have imagined .
and then , it &apos;s all very good for those <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video games still , with <unk> films , the whole imagery of the media landscape i had to create the pictures in my head .
and that was what we had all of the time . if we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our heads .
my response to the drawing was the drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all of that .
i was getting caught by the teachers , as i was hidden , the <unk> .
the creativity had to take somehow out .
and something interesting happened . what was happening to jacques <unk> shows shows , was completely unknown in a completely unknown world here .
i never would like to get a alien world with a spaceship , and that seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk into , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic like all of what i &apos;ve always been introduced to when i read these books .
so i decided to be the age of 15 .
the only problem that was that i lived in a small village in canada , 3,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me <unk> , but not .
i <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , who was on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> center in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , the last 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water underwater , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich in the <unk> live , as rich in life levels are , as we really rarely imagined .
the imagination of nature knows no limits , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
and for the present days , i have the deepest awe for what i see on my view .
and my love keeps holding on the ocean , with the same intensity as ever .
and then as an adult , i was a profession , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner inner to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a kid , i was constantly comic books and so .
so movies , the way , images and stories together , and together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m <unk> from <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so , in <unk> , i could link my <unk> for the <unk> and connecting to the kind of filmmaking .
so , i like , basically my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do so much as liquid <unk> , <unk> , back , back to <unk> animation .
and what came out was the first <unk> <unk> that ever had to see in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t put any money , just said he was going to find his cause a <unk> , but i did a little amazing thing : the audience around the world was <unk> by the magic that went from it .
according to arthur clarke , the law , you know , <unk> technology and the magic isn &apos;t more from each other .
so you saw something magic .
and that &apos;s what i was incredibly exciting .
and i thought , wow , that must be really <unk> into the <unk> . &quot;
so we went into &quot; terminator two , &quot; my next film , still further .
together with <unk> , we made the guy out of liquid metal . the success was very different from how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . but , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more about this movie .
and then , from these two experiences , was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , combined with my good friend , <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , and it was called &quot; digital shrugged . &quot;
and the basic idea of this company was that , phase , <unk> processes with visual printers and so forth and start with digital <unk> .
and then we did that , and then we had a competitive advantage for it .
but the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we actually founded the company in the <unk> -- too slow <unk> .
i had this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; the bar in the <unk> effects of the <unk> , the bar , the bar , the bar , the bar , the bar , the <unk> , and the <unk> should be all the <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar just put it very back , and the people in my company told me that we couldn &apos;t be able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this different film about the big ship , the end .
and the <unk> , i have the <unk> than &quot; romeo and juliet . it was <unk> , an <unk> <unk> of magnitude , a passionate movie .
but i was secretly , actually , i was going to <unk> the <unk> train .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i &apos;ve convinced you , i said , &quot; we &apos;re diving into the train . we &apos;re films that are real <unk> .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the movie .
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good learning indicator marketing . &quot;
and i convinced them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s going to go back to that , that your imagination can create a reality .
we then actually created six months later , one of the things that i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles , and i was looking at the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the actual titanic .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was really .
so , this is really what blew my mind .
and the preparedness is enormous . we had to build cameras and make it all sorts of things .
and i fell on , like this , <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go into these capsule , you &apos;re going to be in these dark , <unk> environments where there &apos;s no hope on saving a rescue , if you can &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the way that you have curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , for which we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
some of the following <unk> , i saw the creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i never had seen before , sometimes things that even had seen before and for the science , and for the science , when we saw them , even had no words .
so this is really <unk> , and i wanted to go .
and so i came up with an unusual decision .
after the success of the &quot; titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice , and i &apos;ll put my <unk> into a while . &quot;
and then we started to <unk> the <unk> , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took little robots that had built a <unk> .
our intention was to look at the insides of the ship , which was never before .
no one had ever explored the inner realm of the <unk> , and you don &apos;t have any means that , so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is quite similar to this <unk> , and i know that once the band had played there .
and i was flying with a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m just <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most <unk> form of a <unk> i &apos;ve ever experienced because before i &apos;ve ever experienced , i &apos;ve always had to see what was going to show in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i went to visit the film when we were going to get the film .
and the set was a very detailed copy of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize that you know , you know , you use such <unk> <unk> and so your consciousness in the car , in that other form of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little bit of what might happen in some decades , if you have a <unk> to study something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after this expeditions , we started to learn what we saw down there , to learn , for example , these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s sort of alien , but here &apos;s on earth .
they live with help from <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in one of sunlight , the system like we do .
and so you see animals that are directly next to a 500 degrees c. that they can survive there .
i was also very interested in the <unk> , which was the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up sitting in the people who have been interested in space and to do the right <unk> , and you drive down russia , and the mission of the <unk> protocol , and all of it , and then fly to the international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , i was going to put us into the deep sea .
i took them and <unk> <unk> to the world at these are extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of these extremes , so they could take around and take them and use instruments and try to move .
we did it , in cognition , was actually working science , more specifically , more specifically .
so , the circle between my existence as a <unk> , at the time , back as a child , and it &apos;s implementing the reality .
and in the course of that discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot of learning .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i certainly think you &apos;re certainly thinking about a director , a director has to be a guide , a leader like a <unk> or something .
i didn &apos;t understand , but i didn &apos;t understand that <unk> , before i <unk> this .
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t get to make us money .
we &apos;re going to play a <unk> of the cost of glory .
everybody think , i &apos;m being &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and had a little <unk> on a towel .
i &apos;ve done all these films , this booking , to a very small audience .
no fame , no credit , no money , and what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it to be the task to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that are , you &apos;re doing it for the sake of the <unk> and because of the weird connection that comes when a small group of people make a team .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked since years , and sometimes we were in two and three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have before each other is because you have a task that you don &apos;t have to explain any other way .
if you go back to shore , you can &apos;t explain the other thing , and the challenges that you &apos;re doing , and the difficulty , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all around the way that you do , and that &apos;s like police police or in the soldier who have gone through and know that you can never explain it .
there &apos;s a connection that comes with respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to do the same leadership , which is that you can be respected and <unk> in return .
and so that &apos;s the dynamic , it &apos;s really changed .
so , i stood back with a little team at <unk> terrain , and we did &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that we haven &apos;t before .
hugely exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were given to a <unk> family for a period of four .
and so , it changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who were supposed to say , we would have to be naked <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more a more nuanced way of doing my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we end from all of that ?
what lessons from we learned ?
i think it &apos;s a good job , in fact , curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human imagination .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the reputation of your team is more important than any world &apos;s world .
i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , as i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t give you a self .
you get other for you . don &apos;t you mind yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself . you take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and explore , we have to be an alternative , because it &apos;s certainly got a <unk> .
no major endeavor , innovation demanded , has ever been addressed to the risk of any major .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i want to leave you with the way , fail , is it &apos;s an alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise , because my favorite research at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed , to make the things that we invent and deliver to give us a better life to make a living in the poorest 2 billion .
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people , just as much as for everybody else on the planet .
<unk> means that the <unk> of many years will not be growing over many years , we &apos;re too little <unk> , and the things are going to change the way that it can &apos;t withstand your fragile environment .
it leads to insecurity . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , the climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also the most important thing is that it &apos;s very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of one thing that you might be able to do the price , the energy system would be far by far , by far .
well , the <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the prize -- let &apos;s get the prize down to half -- we &apos;re going to make the prize for a new barrier and this barrier is based on co2 .
co2 warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> co2 that leads to the <unk> , and perhaps worse , the <unk> , the <unk> of the weather , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the natural change and then collapse whole systems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and by the <unk> of <unk> and where they are going to follow other consequences , there &apos;s some reviews , but not very many .
and there are certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> <unk> : &quot; do we really need to get down to the close ?
does not enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will go .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a <unk> m high truck , under a three foot bridge , and then you can put it in the kind of underneath .
this has to go down , to zero .
well , we &apos;re entering a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow , we have to create change that lower the way down .
it &apos;s been constant speed .
just different economic changes have been influenced by , and we need to go from <unk> to reduction in reducing reduction , reducing down to zero .
so this is the equation of four , a little bit of a bit of a <unk> , you have this thing on the left -- co2 , and that &apos;s going to be a <unk> of the number of people , from the service that every person uses average for every service and the co2 that is <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of the scene and think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of those numbers have to come close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , today &apos;s most <unk> billion people .
and it &apos;s going to go on 9 billion <unk> that are moving on 9 billion .
if we are very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we might probably have to lower it for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we &apos;re going to see 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the services we use .
that includes everything that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
they &apos;re very good things and <unk> , they &apos;re going to make it available to almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably do <unk> and less use , but the average is that these are going to increase in this number of year and grow more than doubles , which is going to be the number of services that are being put together .
here we see a very basic service , and there &apos;s a little bit of the service so you can read the homework ?
and they don &apos;t have the students , so they go out and read their <unk> underneath the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , there are new methods of <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of services whose energy is reduced to 90 percent of the services .
in other ways , like <unk> <unk> , 65 <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; lt : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , the resource supply is very small for improvement .
in the overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might have a reduction in order to be a factor of three or maybe even factor .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now now from 26 billion on maybe <unk> , and it &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is going to be a <unk> unit .
it turns out if you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you &apos;re burning natural gas , no .
almost every cubic source of electricity today , it &apos;s co2 today , except for renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the phrase &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
and people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
normally , there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally , you &apos;re just going to get aside and some of you , don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a miracle in very short of a very short period .
now , i wondered how can i really get that ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of people here ?
i remembered my year when i got a <unk> and somehow people liked this .
and the idea was really , you know , there are people who live with mosquito .
for energy , i was this one .
i decided that this was a <unk> piece of <unk> to be the environment here .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
and you have told me that they don &apos;t bite . they actually don &apos;t even get the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions either , either one or a few of the ways that have unimaginable and unimaginable cause , and although there are many directions in which people are searching for , i really see five , that can be able to afford this big demands .
i &apos;ve gone to tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
maybe this is what makes a <unk> , and if you have a better contribution than i expect to work , that &apos;s what we have to work five , and then we can &apos;t give them up to all of those five , and we can &apos;t give them up because they &apos;re very scary , because they have significant problems .
let &apos;s look at the burning fossil fuel , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there , but it &apos;s not . you have to go out of all the co2 that you burn from the burning of the <unk> , capture pressure , and then you go somewhere and hoping that it &apos;s there .
there &apos;s some <unk> that are going to be a 60 percent , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get a <unk> to get a very difficult for the flow of the footprint , a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it make ?
who can make a difference , which is literally a lot more than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough one .
next : <unk> .
and the <unk> has three big problems . the costs , especially in <unk> countries , the question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite human engagement , that the fuel isn &apos;t being used for the weapon .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns about it .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that you should work on .
the last three of the five ones in the five have put together .
it &apos;s the renewable energy as you &apos;re going to be called .
and also , although it &apos;s great , it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need your fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the density that these technologies make dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> times more than a normal power plant .
they &apos;re also getting these sources of <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine the entire day , it &apos;s not that it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind all the time .
so you have to be able to do that if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have a way to get a way to get the energy in times if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s a big <unk> . if we say that the source source outside is the country , it &apos;s outside , not only need it , not only need the technology , you need to deal with the risk that the energy is different from where .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all made all sorts of the electronic energy , the computer , the world , and that &apos;s the amount of electronic energy that uses the world , as soon as i found out , i found that all the batteries we produce now less than 10 minutes of the <unk> store .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try and get these <unk> sources of people , we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to sustain 100 percent of it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; how do we get to target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of .
in each one of those five areas we need to least 100 people .
so many people are saying , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people who have already put themselves in there .
bill gross has several companies , including a <unk> that has great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> spent dozens of companies doing great things and really , interesting ways , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold , and i finance a company that might be surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there &apos;s some innovation in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few days ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , which one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve thought about this for a long time , but you couldn &apos;t have a breakthrough , but since there &apos;s been modern <unk> since there &apos;s been modern <unk> , you can see it , and see that , yeah , you know , with the right <unk> , it looks like it &apos;s <unk> .
and because you burn those 99 percent , it &apos;s much better than that is a lot better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use waste today as <unk> as you use today .
instead of break the head , they just burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
so , uranium will use it &apos;s a bit of a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of a plank , often than the &quot; <unk> of the reactor . &quot;
that &apos;s what makes the <unk> effect .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is waste that &apos;s 99 percent , and you have the part that &apos;s burned today , <unk> , so it &apos;s so <unk> uranium .
the <unk> <unk> for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal , we need to go to talk about the <unk> .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , and more of the means of agriculture . hopefully , <unk> and cement clean .
so to reach that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> are completely reorder .
the other note is whether we use the <unk> technology , whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is a key component of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , how should it look like by 2020 ?
it should have the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to make reducing the road , and the less we <unk> , the smaller the <unk> are , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things we do is to do not fully affect the big <unk> , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs are we need to be <unk> with <unk> , and we can measure them : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are lots of great books on this topic .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , and david mash &apos;s &quot; <unk> energy <unk> &quot; the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through and creating a framework where this can be discussed , because we need to have support for the advice of all sides .
there &apos;s a few things that come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very rough wish we invent this technology .
if you &apos;re just going to talk to me for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love this wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , that wish i would take a look .
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long and <unk> are being terrible between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich <unk> and almost all life of that two billion are going to be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more funding for more research .
if countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should discuss this <unk> and you would be shocked by the silly low money that will be spent on these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , we &apos;re driving , we &apos;re <unk> &amp; amp ; t , something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have to have a dialogue and complete a whole lead and the things that are going to be undertaken by the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand <unk> , you can see a glimpse of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation of a supercomputer , we need to have a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable works , it &apos;s only about the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> , more billion , and the place that actually building the first one of them .
once the first thing is , when he &apos;s going to walk , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economic economy , energy is so different than the <unk> , as we know it .
so to understand that right , that means deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column nuclear nuclear power , that consumed <unk> , and then the process starts to go up and it &apos;s going to continue to work on top ?
<unk> : right . so there &apos;s a lot of people going to go wrong , so there are lots of people who can go wrong . this thing where you open it and make things <unk> or <unk> . it &apos;s not good !
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think about a plank that you &apos;re buried with , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s done for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which gives you a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens with the waste : you can sit there -- there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already , in these <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> , that &apos;s our high-capacity transportation system .
so , what &apos;s really about these reactors was , what is that we fill in our own and that will reduce the pace of dramatically over the process of this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked about different people in this world about these options .
where is the greatest interest in this , so what really does ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t set up to a place that &apos;s called a nuclear &quot; in the name , and there &apos;s a lot more interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name , and the people of the company in russia , india , and i talked about the <unk> and i talked about how this is going to be <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something that way .
this is a version of one that made it done .
and this is a step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some of the countries have built this , so everybody who has done a quick reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your mind , <unk> and chance to make something like that really , really ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to reinvent , and then 20 years .
this is kind of the deadline that we &apos;ve demonstrated to have demonstrated us that we have to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could hold it easy .
and luckily , it &apos;s dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of companies , the way that they work , for example , for the <unk> , for which to do it , for the <unk> .
and it would be best if it can get multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
and the big big breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would be without the <unk> , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be difficult , but maybe they say that .
and so there &apos;s a different thing , but the nice thing about it is , that &apos;s the <unk> , that is , you know , the radiation , the footprint , and the costs , the potential , is the potential , the potential , is the potential , so the impact on land and other things , almost in a different league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we have to use <unk> to try and maintain the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come in this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve eaten too much , and just before a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is called the different techniques , to delay warming , so that we would spend 20 or 30 years longer to get us in the <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t even work insurance because you might not only work on the insurance because you might keep eating it because you know that one that is going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re smart , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you have to have available to the available , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> if things come faster or that innovation longer needs , than we expect .
<unk> : did you have a or two sentences to you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , life &apos;s the skeptics in very different camps .
those of the scientific arguments are very little .
say that there are negative effects that are going to move to the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell , which is there a chance to be there .
the <unk> here is like this at aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of <unk> problems , you know , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst of the fact , and it &apos;s not necessarily the worst of the state , and there are people in the rich world that look at the looking at the other and say , okay , this is not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and then the co2 is removed , and then the skeptics is , i wish it &apos;s not co2 , i wish it &apos;s not a co2 , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be the answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you &apos;re using all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , the <unk> that is causing for malaria and so on that there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money while there are better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual health research for the research -- say , we should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- that &apos;s not quite dramatic .
they don &apos;t even suffer other things .
and you get to big <unk> , and there &apos;s reasonable people who disagree with something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to finance it , and it &apos;s trying to finance it , and for me , is most of the waste .
because , you know , you &apos;re very short about a <unk> and <unk> , and funded the learning learning . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much more expensive .
if the <unk> you get a very high , very high , you can only hold the rich .
i mean , each of us could spend five times as much for our energy without living .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> , it &apos;s about .
and his new <unk> is , &quot; why is not going to be about research in the research ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s going to bring the <unk> now .
and this is a kind of <unk> that i think for appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that is going to be supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all of the people here , if i say , i really hope you will . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , i put a <unk> <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> , the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti spaghetti , about 12,000 tape , about three and a meter <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top of it .
and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s really hard to get people to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> &apos;s <unk> and there &apos;s something about this quest to share deep sensations in nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them .
normally , most people start to orient themselves in the task .
they talk about it , they think about how it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
and then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they drawing and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re all <unk> structures in the <unk> of the <unk> structures .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time more time , someone &apos;s marshmallow and you put it gently down on the top , step back and &quot; <unk> ! &quot; they don &apos;t admire their work .
but then , almost always , is happening that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; have &quot; <unk> &quot; than others , and under the worst , <unk> are <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really produce <unk> .
and of course there &apos;s also teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; and under the best , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and as we told us , we don &apos;t just produce it , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you &apos;re going to be asking is , how does this happen ? why ? what about that ?
and peter &apos;s saying , &quot; neither of the children in the children were going to be in the head of spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t have time to go into <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> are trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then we realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar with what ?
what makes a difference is that they start with the marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they could have the opportunity to fix <unk> prototypes .
<unk> , this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids get stronger feedback and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , and it &apos;s a lot of time to do different ways of working together .
average for most of the most , in about <unk> , <unk> are going to be half of them , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
and a meter is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they are producing <unk> and <unk> geometric pattern of the key to build robust structures .
ceos are about average . but here &apos;s interesting .
put a <unk> <unk> in the team , you &apos;re significant better .
it &apos;s amazing . you see around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they &apos;re bringing the process , understand it .
and the team that regulates that to the <unk> and the work of the team will be significant to the teams .
and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> and connecting with success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get six , the robust structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , we get the <unk> right .
so i offered a $ <unk> dollar prize for software for the winner .
what happened to do with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this was not a team . it &apos;s not a team structure .
if somebody had a <unk> operation , he would have been carried the price for the home .
so it &apos;s not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
so what did you think ?
now you understand the benefit of &quot; <unk> . &quot;
that &apos;s how the same , bad team of one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
there are <unk> lessons for us , the nature of the engine and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest in a <unk> practice ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is they help to identify the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , or an ethos , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can go to <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find mad examples of all the world , like people to optimize the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all have our senses to do the task , and that we think we &apos;re thinking about optimal , like our emotions and our own , in the challenge that &apos;s been in the challenge .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all that it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we have this one machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everyone in this room must .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t go here and stay in here .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve been asked my friends in the question , and they wanted to go to all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time , before they gave cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s search for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re drawn to <unk> , <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because no possibility of this planet don &apos;t go back , go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that the ever on this planet , no matter what scale you are : health , wealth , wealth , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> died when they were 60 .
my grandparents would have been made up to <unk> this number .
my parents are on the <unk> .
so there &apos;s better to be a <unk> of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s been born in new delhi is expecting to be born as long as the richest man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an unbelievable fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have created the demographics of the earth in a way that it &apos;s never made a war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . pop .
in the rich world there are diseases that are actually given us to a generation of a generation , no more .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone know what that &apos;s ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are the scientific method of the scientific method .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try and look at if it works , it works , if it doesn &apos;t , is one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is the good news news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , one billion people on this world are hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , oil , oil , gas : they disappear , and they &apos;re soon , and if we don &apos;t go from that chaos , we &apos;re also going to disappear from this chaos .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
and i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which will feed billions of people without rape and rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t even break at the same time .
i think that really , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this keeps me sitting at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night , we &apos;ve never had to have science progress , as we have yet , before .
and we were also never able to do it , it &apos;s reasonable <unk> , as we can now .
we &apos;re at the cusp of an amazing , amazing events , and yet i really think we have to go back to many places , and yet i really think we &apos;d have to go back to the enlightenment to find a time where we have progress in which we have to have progress on these things , more than now .
people are clinging to their faith , and they &apos;re so tightly , that you can &apos;t free it .
no longer will it &apos;s going to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right to think , even a pretty much of a no-brainer mind .
but you know , what you don &apos;t have ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure out out .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article about <unk> for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to the opposition to the opposition toward what the most effective operation operation in the health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i was doing whatever i do , i wrote an article and i started driving .
and soon i wrote an article about genetically food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people played crazy .
so i wrote a paper , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they thought molecules was a random way of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and i found out why , and i found out .
and that &apos;s because those who i &apos;m crazy was not not allowed to all the counsel .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and this was so confused ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress , like earlier .
we &apos;re talking about this .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little quotes about this : progress .
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what are the reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that should not be that .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they would always be right . they were skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything as a result .
but now , if you get evidence , you have to take evidence of this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at all .
and i can tell that from the reason that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible history that brought the <unk> with the tornado , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
so many studies have been doing to see if it was true .
there &apos;s been a lot of studies in the study of doing it ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no correlation .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what makes us think of what makes us feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a <unk> from a <unk> , that &apos;s the data that we have data , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re doing that .
but do you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
<unk> because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> are falling for 1,600 .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s someone who are upset ?
has one in the audience ever to see someone in the audience ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
if it &apos;s not happening in this country , but it &apos;s been in the world last year .
these are many deaths by immunized , 20 per hour .
but because this is not here , we can put it in denial and people like jenny and <unk> messages from fear and illiteracy from platforms like &quot; and larry king live .
and they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting cause and connection .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst human rights .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t go so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people who developed a <unk> .
he can save lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , this is good , except paul <unk> and talking about vaccines , and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul speaks to a public realm , it cannot tell the <unk> <unk> .
he gets calls calls because people like to tell them that they know where his children go to school .
why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them , return to the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we have now fought in this country now .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon children get to die again , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s do it . why not ?
a couple of me was writing a few weeks ago , and i think i &apos;m a bit of <unk> .
no one told ever before .
she couldn &apos;t get their child off the child . no fall .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , perhaps , i got to go to a plane tomorrow , and flying in a plane and fly to los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s going to land , and it &apos;s going to go to long beach , and it &apos;s going to visit one of the <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it isn &apos;t .
we love us to freeze , we love this . we love that .
did you have all of your vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , which helps you to get the bar on .
i know you did that , because half of the americans do it every day .
they take stuff , and they &apos;re taking alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly taking it .
they consume their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark , urine .
i &apos;m not agree with them .
dark , urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate to strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our health system is obligatory .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> himself to us who can afford to .
so we &apos;re walking away from that , and where are we going to go to run ?
we &apos;re walking into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions dollars .
and i have all kinds of little <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , blah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions dollars for it , it &apos;s been cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , i say people , and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let &apos;s do what you want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t me whether it &apos;s the <unk> , who says , &quot; hmm , i will not adopt the evidence of my experts to mammography &quot; or any <unk> , who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to this path , where belief and science and science is replacing , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 people to do because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective drugs that we know that they can determine the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any other of these disease .
tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
well , the most enterprising epidemic we &apos;re right now is that this is a struggle between the <unk> <unk> of <unk> foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , every branch , every single time , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did this all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked and some of it .
we got rid of what it didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specific . and of course , we can do it , but we can do something like vitamin <unk> , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , to extend their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we dismiss the <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m going to do is , &quot; too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be a big fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies .
we don &apos;t want to have companies .
and you know what my response to all of this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not land .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it &apos;s not working , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to be a real <unk> , and it &apos;s keeping millions of people from the earth .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow more food than you have to grow more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? <unk> food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like cassava .
it &apos;s a little half billion people , something that &apos;s going to eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s about like a thread .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s painful .
it has no protein , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this in there .
and then people could eat that and would not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it would be not <unk> <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is , why do we stop this ?
i mean , ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to do genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> for greater food , better food , an unprecedented food .
it &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to understand the highest time to understand what that means .
because what do you know ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so on , and so far , we &apos;re guilty about something that we don &apos;t believe , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we need to really stop that .
so after this incredibly funny thing , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go and go into this ridiculous machine machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to fall . that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to .
and right now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an unbelievable opportunity .
we can put this time machine , what we want .
we can <unk> where we want them to <unk> , and we &apos;ll move them where we want .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the machine machine and we &apos;ll go to the future , we &apos;ll be happy to go to do that .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that needs now to take .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , and it may seem odd that a magician is interested in that , because you look at it as i like , &quot; a deception that will be something to be a little bit if someone is only stuck enough to believe it . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have shown an emergent effect , which is just about that , and it &apos;s just because of the time , for example , is shown to the emergent , <unk> , for example , there &apos;s only one of the things that the patient is only stuck enough to believe that it &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the <unk> .
a deception is going to be something that is going to be , because somebody knows it .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s is in every <unk> for children .
i &apos;ve learned him from the <unk> <unk> <unk> magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;m going to explain it .
so , look , what happens .
the knife that you can investigate ; my hand , which you can study .
i &apos;m just going to put the knife down to my hand .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing comes out of my sleeve or out of it , i just will just put my wrist right here .
and you can see that , you can see that no one has moved anything , and as long as i can get there , nothing can go to the sleeve or get out of my sleeve .
and the goal is just simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will absorb my bare physical plug .
in fact , it &apos;s so stuck in the room that i can shake it , without the knife .
nothing moves in my sleeve or comes out , not <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> , and i want to be optimistic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you here in the room know this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist <unk> , to make sure that nothing is going to disappear or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to do my wrist is that it &apos;s really the secret of the illusion .
because the moment i &apos;m going to see my hand from you , so you see this , moving from the back , that &apos;s fingers , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position that he is so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting back in the back , which is no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and if i &apos;m <unk> , the fingers changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you can &apos;t realize that there &apos;s a deception , and the way it &apos;s is that the way that it &apos;s is to make information processing , it &apos;s not one , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but this is not really not . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not through the body &apos;s counterintuitive , it &apos;s through a trick , through my favorite <unk> that &apos;s now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing i &apos;m going to do is , is the same thing that i &apos;m going to fall through that motion is going to happen , that the fingers is <unk> .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick , you can just give your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
one year ago , or so , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and so this was an amazing thing .
and it turns out , if you put a placebo of a <unk> in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round of white pill that has a particular effect .
but if you make the shape that you &apos;re going to change in a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although no one of any of them -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freaking me out ?
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a fake , you &apos;re more effective than any of those things that are .
a colored capsule , which is in a end of yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
also the viability is a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key but is ...
and that &apos;s what the <unk> play is a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to <unk> the ultimate needle , you have to reach for the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> substance , a few <unk> substance that you &apos;re being injected to a patient .
this is a very strong image in the head , which is much more powerful than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a mirror .
so the fact is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule that looks as good as the needle .
and none of them has any really <unk> property , and it &apos;s only our belief in which we &apos;ve seen a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that obviously is a deception , and it &apos;ll make it real look .
we know that in the study , we have to reach out of the needle if it &apos;s supposed to be to the needle .
this is a <unk> <unk> long , and it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;ll first give you a little bit of <unk> .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and it &apos;s going to take it through it until she goes back to the other side .
if you &apos;re going to be a little bit -- if you drop it down -- i &apos;ve demonstrated a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s a woman almost cowboy .
so i propose if you will quickly get a little bit , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first taste part here .
you can see it , you can also see them , but you can also <unk> .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a little baby .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it go crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the polar regions .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not that stupid and <unk> itself the skin , just to talk for us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
so , what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people behind the back , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the <unk> are going to go in .
let me show you about it .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can browse .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re sick , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people in the back , and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; well , this is pretty impressive , but if it was really , it would be -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it was really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take out the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this framework , and with the intention of making a deception of something , i &apos;m just going to let the needle just go and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few more time in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re excited . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
i &apos;ve just got some people who count the number of books that are published in the last five years , and they gave up about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among explorers .
there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these <unk> of work , there are several cognitive records that we kind of have to do , and to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive traps .
and this is true for <unk> that &apos;s thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are as mess as any other .
the first one of these traps is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply no useful word anymore , because we &apos;re using it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning where we could just push it , but in large and all of the time we &apos;re going to have to give up , and we &apos;ll take the complicated perspective on what &apos;s well-being .
the second thing is a <unk> of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;re being between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affect wellness , without knowing what to do .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i would like to start with an example of someone who had a story , a story , a story , and he was saying , he would have heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added to add quite emotional , that has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
and what it was made was the memories of experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
they don &apos;t count , because he was ruined with a memory of <unk> , the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what really tells us that is that we think about ourselves and other people think about the senses of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , capable of experiencing the past again , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know if the physician says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m going to put it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our life is , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor wants to be able to ask by saying , &quot; how did you feel over lately ? &quot;
or &quot; how did your journey go ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two is always <unk> , part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that starts really , really , a basic response to our memories -- it &apos;s beginning to happen .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we do to tell stories about stories .
our minds told us stories , which means that what we &apos;re allowed to do is to keep a story .
and let &apos;s start with a kind of start with a second .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients who are acting in a painful process .
i &apos;m not going to go into that . it &apos;s not painful , but it was not painful , but it was a study that was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds to report their pain .
and here are two patients . they &apos;re their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has been clear more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a single patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much of these patients were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient had a much worse <unk> of the <unk> than the patient had been for b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and it &apos;s a very critical part of the story as it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the ones that are worse , where the pain was at the end of its height , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we &apos;ve asked these people to their <unk> and they would say , &quot; how bad was all the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for a b in <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the point of view of the <unk> , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient a , and we did it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually get the <unk> of the patient a bit by simply shake the tube in it without too much to shake it .
that will lead that the patient &apos;s disease , but only a little bit and much less than before .
and if you make a few minutes long , the <unk> self is a good deal , and you have made that the <unk> self even of your patient is a much better deal , because now you have given a better story about your experience .
and what draws a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that make memory and it applies to the stories we invent .
and so a story of <unk> are shifting , significant moments and end .
end , very , very important , and in this case , the end .
well , the <unk> self lives are living on .
it has moments of the <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean most of our lives -- and i &apos;ve been able to do this -- you know that &apos;s a <unk> present , you know , that there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . there &apos;s about 600,000 , and most of you don &apos;t leave you about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> themselves .
and yet , you get the idea that you should count that what happens during these moments of the <unk> .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re using as we are in the world .
and as we consume them , it &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal with time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation , the second week is so good , like the first , then the <unk> vacation is going to be twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
so that &apos;s not going to work at all .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> vacation hardly barely better than the <unk> calendar , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is the critical variable that makes a <unk> self from a <unk> self , and has a very little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self makes more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually that , because if you have a patient , you say , &quot; if you have a patient , you know , what you want to choose , then the one that memory has been to vote is , the one that memory has less bad and that is the surgeon who will be chosen .
the <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we &apos;re voting in memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think our future as a experience .
we think about our future to be memories of memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can think of the <unk> self , which is kind of the <unk> of the <unk> , you can &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the idea that if we &apos;re doing a very often very often , that means we &apos;re going to end up on holiday on the service of the <unk> self .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get away from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s been given to the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we did in antarctica , i think , clearly , the most exciting part that i ever had , and i think i often have a lot of times in proportion to the relationship , how often i think about other people &apos;s most profound .
and i &apos;ve probably got my memories of my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say 25 minutes for 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had opened the folder that the <unk> of 600 images , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s about a decade .
there seems to be a <unk> .
now , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you do more of them , there &apos;s a real question , why do we give memories of that much weight in the <unk> of the weight that we &apos;re going to compute ?
so i want to think that you think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the concert you all get <unk> , you get wiped out the images , and you get a <unk> drug , so you will remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same thing ?
and if you would choose a different holidays , you have a conflict between your two senses of self and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to think about how you &apos;re going to think about how you get this conflict , and if you think about memories of memories , you might have a different answer .
why we pick the <unk> , we pick up a problem that provides us with a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two types of self are two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness we can use , one per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the average self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- lucky enough for moments , is quite a complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness itself over time .
if you ask the happiness of the <unk> , it &apos;s a whole different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy is living .
it &apos;s like being happy or funny , the person is about their lives .
very different term .
and everybody who &apos;s not different from these terms of happiness , and i &apos;m involved with a lot of researchers about wellness , which are made for happiness long , on exactly these kinds of happiness .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and the satisfaction of the <unk> self is recognized in the last several years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global survey that has been asked over half a million people , where they &apos;ve been asked about their lives and their experience , and there were other effort in the direction .
so in the last years we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two forms of self .
and the key one we think is , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that doesn &apos;t teach you how happy he live his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation that is about <unk> .
what that means is , if you &apos;re going to meet somebody and you would say you , oh dad , dad is a <unk> , how much would you meet over your size ?
well , you would have something about your size , but there &apos;s lots of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has a life as eight to a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> self .
so correlation with a correlation .
we know something about what makes happiness of the suv .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means to be satisfied with people we like , time with people we like , time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s a real dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky to maximize the two species of the other , you &apos;re going to have different things to do .
the implication of what i &apos;ve been saying is that we &apos;re not really lucky to think about it as a repair for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , just a very short reason , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t pay attention to the same things that we think about life and when we &apos;re actually living .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are they won &apos;t get the right answer .
if you think that question , you think that people in california need to be happier , if you say , in ohio , live .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could end up to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , which is going to happen to people who are going to go to california , to happier , to happier .
well , your <unk> self will not become happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re happier because if you &apos;re thinking about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of it , like the <unk> weather in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think , and think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we did a couple of weeks ago , i talked to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this place .
is this something that is to be able to share with us , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the gallup survey is a number we had absolutely not thought to find .
we found that in terms of the <unk> self .
if we were looking at the way , how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , under a 60 dollar year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big <unk> sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year people are unhappy , and they &apos;re more happy , the poorer they will .
we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t take a <unk> , but that lack of money is a <unk> , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
the more money you make it is you have .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , the total american effort is going to live , freedom , quest for happiness .
if people were seriously taking this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all in mind , everything that we believe , for example , on <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country generally would seem to be a <unk> <unk> like the serious and then make sure that it would make politics ?
<unk> : you know , i believe there &apos;s recognition for the role of the <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom you &apos;re going to happen and in other countries , you &apos;re going to happen .
people are realizing that they should think of happiness when they think politics .
it &apos;ll take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to explore or whether they want to study <unk> , so we need to be a <unk> <unk> .
as you &apos;re lucky , you can think about it , as you think about how you think and whether you think about the <unk> yourself , or whether you think about the <unk> yourself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two , of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this subject , or should at least the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m making video games .
i &apos;ve been making <unk> for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as it is to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time with playing more and more productive games .
now we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a whole bunch of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little bit too much time when you consider how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute on the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not enough enough to solve the most important issues in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century , we need to increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that that &apos;s been the fact that the cost of 21 billion hours are just a week .
this may seem something <unk> , so i &apos;m seeing it , so i think it &apos;s possible to solve , if we want to solve problems , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to play the next decade .
no , i mean it really serious .
why ? this image describes pretty much why i believe games is so essential for survival of human species . seriously .
this is a portrait portrait of <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to catch the feelings playing with play , so he &apos;s got a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you may be some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see that sense of urgency , something fear , but also concentration , <unk> , to solve a really hard problem .
if you play , you see some of the suburbs , which is going to the top of the <unk> , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the outskirts of a so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some player here .
a <unk> victory is a result , so so it &apos;s so positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked , you actually are capable of being able to do this . that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this player is short on a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see about millions of <unk> around the world , if we are taking the <unk> of the next century , the face of which , against all the <unk> at the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more seeing this face in real life , if we &apos;re facing difficult problems .
i call it a &quot; <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yes , ok ? ok .
this is me , i &apos;m bad , i &apos;m bad doing this .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , california , where i was doing in my dissertation , why we &apos;re better than in games .
this is a problem that many player have .
we think we don &apos;t think so good in the reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s one .
we get more and more . i &apos;m dealing with the relationship with the motivation , something <unk> , inspired by collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think many of us are going to turn into our best version , anytime , and immediately , you can get to solving the problem , try and try and try it as long as long as it takes to try to try to try to try to try to try to test the <unk> again .
and in reality , if we were failing down , we feel different from the obstacles .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel ourselves . we feel threatened by , possibly depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these emotions , we never have , if we play games , they &apos;re just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to do as a student student .
why is it impossible to be in games , to think , you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we apply these feelings to the reality of the actual mind ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which gives you the ideal environment to the communal problem problem .
and i found some things that <unk> <unk> are going to be able to do in <unk> .
so first , first , if you go into one of these <unk> , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots of different characters that are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and it immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at its current level , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the side of your skills , so they have to work , and there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and <unk> , and there &apos;s always really very specific to do things .
and there &apos;s plenty of people .
where you &apos;re also going , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy , that feeling that there are a <unk> group of <unk> staff .
and then there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get positive feedback .
they &apos;re wired up from &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + a strength &quot; is &quot; <unk> or a <unk> . &quot;
that &apos;s constant feedback isn &apos;t there in true life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk to a <unk> and a <unk> crazy idea , a <unk> 20 insane idea .
i &apos;m getting this feedback in real life .
so the problem of warcraft , the problem of warcraft , is that it &apos;s so gratifying to stand on the edge of a <unk> , that we would rather have our time in this honeycomb system .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
and today , all the world of <unk> <unk> have spent together for the last several years , to solve virtual problems of <unk> .
it &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it may sound nasty .
but in context , in fact , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go to the first <unk> .
so the first one in primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re playing with play , it makes sense , when you &apos;re going to be able to look at scale of human development , what is extraordinary .
but also appropriate . because it turns out that by doing all the time we use this time , actually , changing what we &apos;re capable of .
we &apos;re developing <unk> thinking very much , very common .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
look at this interesting statistics that recently launched from a researcher named <unk> university : the average young man in a country with great <unk> spends 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st of year .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first , for kids in the united states , they are <unk> hours of the precise <unk> that they spend in school , the fifth grade , to the end of high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a fully fully <unk> , where young people are learning as what it means to be a good player , like anything else that you learn from school .
and maybe some of you have new book of &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the success of the success of the success of the success .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that if we were studying 10,000 hours studying the amount of any subject to the 21st century , we &apos;re going to be the master in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever people do , as the most significant people in the world .
so , what we have here is a full generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the good guys doing good ? &quot;
because if we could find that out , we would have never have to have a potential of potential human potential .
so many people have now in the world at least an hour of <unk> .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people , who are extraordinarily good in something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion player that are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> developed <unk> developed , the energy aid , save the energy and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so player around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , could play online .
you expect a more extra billion player in the next decade .
we have a whole billion of a player .
so i started thinking about what it is to make us with the games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine the way extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do anything , to do something , to do a challenge , together with that belief that we have a <unk> hope on success .
so the player always believe that a <unk> victory is capable and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so , the player are masters in spiders are social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show you that we &apos;re going to like people who are playing with you , even if you &apos;ve defeated the rotten .
the reason that there requires a lot of trust with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody has to spend time with us that the rules will be made of the same target , and to keep the same goal .
so the <unk> is growing by <unk> , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re going to build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours play a week , sort of as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we don &apos;t relax or anything .
we know that we are becoming less optimal , if we &apos;re going to do hard work .
and player are always willing to work hard if you get the right job .
and ultimately , in the process , epic .
players love to be able to get some more convenient to the <unk> of the <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> to back that on the right light , you know all wikipedia , the world &apos;s greatest carpet .
the second largest producer in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in every other world .
it &apos;s creating a epic story .
it &apos;s creating a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome , player are <unk> , hopeful .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change virtual worlds , but not the real one .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people are so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not witnessed less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i &apos;m playing games , i &apos;m a little bit more <unk> .
so he says that makes sense , because the player can reach more than real life .
you can get stronger social <unk> than real life , and you get more feedback and reward in games as real life .
so he says , it &apos;s just completely logical , that player is more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree that i &apos;m going to do .
but it definitely is not a <unk> .
we need to start transforming the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that took 2,500 years .
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
this amazing climber was <unk> .
and they were kind of <unk> <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> of the old greek <unk> , you may know that story . the story about how and why play games were invented .
according to <unk> , games were invented , more <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> during famine .
there was such a great famine , that the king of <unk> decided to be a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , national strategy , and on a day you would eat , you &apos;d play national strategy . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> <unk> , because games are so fascinating and we &apos;re going to have a <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would not have to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , it &apos;s been so 18 years for the age of getting this famine , by having a day and playing on a day .
so , i think , let &apos;s play games today .
we &apos;re going to take games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing a games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work , everything that doesn &apos;t work in real life , and we &apos;re catching ourselves what we need to play .
but that &apos;s not the end .
this is exciting .
according to the <unk> , the famine was not better , so the king , the last <unk> , <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> , and the <unk> were allowed to get to an <unk> adventure .
they <unk> <unk> and went looking for a new home , and they went to search for a new home , and they just went back so many people , like , in the food , and were looking for the rest of a neighborhood they could thrive in .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , which is the later empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists recently , recently , <unk> , crazy history is true .
and geologists found a global <unk> , almost 20 years , and i would have been explaining to explain what the famine might be .
so this crazy story could be voices .
and you might actually have saved your people by play for 18 years by games for <unk> , and then they had this <unk> and so much about this to play with each other , that they &apos;ve saved all the civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing for &quot; for &quot; 71 . &quot;
this was the first <unk> in real time of the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing on a <unk> for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own personal game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to find a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should have been in the <unk> , half of us spend an hour of play with play until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to be asking , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and that &apos;s the question i &apos;ve dedicated my work to the institute of the institute in the institute of the future .
we have this banner in palo alto , it &apos;s <unk> from how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best outcome , and then we &apos;re willing to empower this idea to do this idea of reality .
we &apos;re going to <unk> ourselves and give people the opportunity to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i designed to try to get people in the <unk> state in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is about 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to overcome through a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , and then they get real <unk> in time that they &apos;re going to be close to , say , they &apos;re realistic , and they have to figure out whether there &apos;s been there . and they have to figure out how they &apos;re going to be true , and they have to figure out how they &apos;re going to be true , and it would be true , and we ask them to be blogging about it , videos or photos .
we &apos;ve tested with roman <unk> , and we &apos;ve been tested them since the last three years , and we &apos;ve been running over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an inclusive experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an <unk> adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they would survive , most of our players have to make their habits in the game .
so we have a bit of <unk> , and we put a bigger goal of the way , put it in a bigger goal .
we developed the game , &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute of the future .
we start the calculation of a <unk> that &apos;s only going to have 23 years on the planet .
this is the supercomputer called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call on player , on , <unk> , we &apos;ve made almost like a <unk> <unk> .
you know , the jerry <unk> , where there &apos;s the &quot; <unk> &quot; there , and you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and just together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 : a game was eight weeks .
they found 500 , <unk> solutions that you can read when they &apos;re google .
and the last thing we get to play three : the third of march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the world bank , you get the <unk> of social <unk> , end 2010 .
we work with universities in the very special city and shop to learn social change .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high , to <unk> , <unk> , sustainability and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , who will benefit from themselves together to create their own social companies to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic gamers , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have saved the real world .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree that you agree with me that there are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games are a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got these entire superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to engage with <unk> social networks , <unk> and desire to make sense of <unk> .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing together with great games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with these games .
when i go back to the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things that we can create any <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start with the <unk> !
thank you .
i would like to tell you something that was a few months ago , when i write a article for <unk> magazine .
i always have been doing my breakfast at the end , but i was done with the process of text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never done before in my life , which means &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled &quot; , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;
i was going to read this list from a friend , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i couldn &apos;t get to read , and couldn &apos;t stop reading and so quickly , and they took me to this <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> of the heart of shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought that the copy was going to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i was working with elementary school , and began my self outside of my family circle , and also shape , and also , in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god was not really using a <unk> god .
if i was going to take this post seriously , i would be born to a world that someone like me would perceive a person whose life can make positive in any way , but now i &apos;m going to have been the opportunity for the opportunity and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately got to the <unk> of 2009 and expect that i found a <unk> piece .
this is the <unk> version of this amoeba .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better about the time .
and specifically , my last two words under &quot; <unk> &quot; are &quot; &quot; all healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who describe this words .
it &apos;s about the values that are put in this words , and how we build this values .
our language changes our minds and how we see the world and people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the one of the greek and the romans , really believe that the pronunciation was a <unk> , because what you &apos;re supposed to do is , you know , <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a disabled person or a healthy person ?
just to call a people more than a child , it could be enough , and they &apos;re <unk> and ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them up ?
one person who opened up to me was my pediatrician at the <unk> institute of <unk> institute in <unk> .
he called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t have exactly the same formula , so he always became dr. p. .
and dr. p. <unk> was always very colorful flies and was just done for the work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just loved -- to my <unk> .
i had to be able to do a little bit infinitely often with these thick , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to build my <unk> -- and i hated these fishermen more than anything else . i did it . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even did have a <unk> kid with dr. robicsek and trying to stop this practice , <unk> without success .
and one day he looked at me in a little bit -- this practice was just heavy <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to give one day of these tape .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and this was just a simple trick of dr. seuss so i &apos;m doing the kind of work i don &apos;t want to do with the chance that i &apos;m not going to do the practice , but he actually has brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i &apos;m wondering how much his vision of mine as strong and powerful young girls have shaped my self and i could imagine that i could imagine as a natural nature of strong , powerful and <unk> .
this is just one example of many , as adults in <unk> can make a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the best examples of these examples of the <unk> , we cannot imagine our language , something that we all want to wish : to give you each other , to see yourself as a healthy person .
our language <unk> the social change , which was caused in many cases by a technological transformation .
and then , of course , the limitations that allow you to do the opportunity to create the <unk> platforms , which is to develop the <unk> of the social standpoint , people will provide themselves to social possibilities , people will provide themselves to own own identity , in its own way , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to engage the world at the world , and they &apos;re realizing the world that they &apos;re choosing .
so maybe this technological change is more clearly , which is that every human being said , is that every human ability to be able to make a difference in society to create something very <unk> and that the human ability to adapt to , in order , is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt to you -- this is a very interesting story , because people are never <unk> me , and i &apos;ve never been saying to do a lot of uncomfortable to say that , and i felt really uncomfortable to try to answer the questions of people , and i think i &apos;m going to understand why .
this set of <unk> lives on the idea that success or happiness should be so successful , and as if my life would be so successful , because i could get the potential to a life with a prosthesis , or as people can see me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course , we &apos;re the challenge of the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally , or both of them .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a barrier that we have to <unk> to get better with our lives .
<unk> are just alive .
and i tend to see <unk> as a shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present sometimes , sometimes he &apos;s barely seeing , but it &apos;s constantly in me .
and i just want to impact that by no means of the impact , or the severe one of the human genome .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just more useful and every person in the same way , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get <unk> or not , but how we get to it .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for people to keep <unk> , and to keep it in front of <unk> , but also to prepare for it to get good enough to it .
and we don &apos;t have to have our kids , if we give them the feeling they can &apos;t adapt themselves .
you have to separate two things : one of the medical fact , to be an m.d. and the other people &apos;s greatest view is whether i &apos;m a disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and enduring , to me , i had to be able to get apart with the definitions that the world is constantly saying , and then they can describe me with this definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are going to protect us , and to make sure of the point of the <unk> of the quality of life that you expect , we need to look after we don &apos;t really have to put the thing that somebody is actually disabled .
maybe the current concept that is just looking at it , which is just the case of which we &apos;re going to fix , and how we repair that , for every single one greater disability than a living in time .
if we don &apos;t treat people a man , not all of its forces and possibilities and acknowledge , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead to another disease .
we <unk> a man who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and we &apos;re focusing on all the human possibilities .
and most important , is that there &apos;s between perception and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not be these <unk> times , or failure , we should not try to avoid them , avoid them , and we should go to the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing the <unk> opportunities .
i think it may be more about to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome the <unk> , but that we are open to hug them to embrace them , and maybe even dance to that .
and perhaps we can do it as a kind of natural , <unk> and useful , and feel so much about their presence as a result of their presence .
this year we celebrate 200 , the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution , darwin , in my mind , has been proven to something very true in the human character .
i would propose it : not the most powerful of his kind of surviving , and also not the <unk> of its way , but the one that can adapt to the best .
it &apos;s creativity from conflict .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , from the clash of human mind , is defined by conflict .
so again , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of humans .
and maybe we know , we know , we &apos;re just going out of what kind of wood we &apos;re going to be , if we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps the meaning of <unk> , a perception of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves a little bit like this .
we can make a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see more <unk> than change .
<unk> are for change , which we haven &apos;t yet adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so , honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . but the typical . but not the normal thing , and if you were to have the poor , gray person want to learn if you really would have ?
i think more like not .
it would be great if we could use the normal to another , or the strength , to even be a bit more dangerous to <unk> , so we can release forces of very many children , and they &apos;re willing to invite them to bring their whole special and valuable skills to society .
<unk> found out that we &apos;ve always found people of our own members of our society , to be useful and to do a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that already , in the neanderthal , the neanderthal had been carried and people with severe physical injuries , and that would be because the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of these people was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and <unk> , they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city i grew up in a <unk> in the <unk> in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there before a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man , i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her to her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so the one .
and of course , it &apos;s done , but it &apos;s done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i knew about stories about this day , because i of course , quite typical , to my birthday , two weeks to late .
the doctor for <unk> imaging , my mom &apos;s vacation , and so my parents had to get the man to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet came to them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , that foreign to had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say you had to walk , i had to say you couldn &apos;t walk , and you never have to be so <unk> , and you &apos;ve never had to have a independent life , and then you have just lying to me . &quot;
i found that he had collected from a <unk> in the second grade , whether i was <unk> at a <unk> in the second grade , and he &apos;s used these clips to teach his students , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough to emphasize how the key factor of the human life can be to be human .
and dr. <unk> told the next , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned kids , if you don &apos;t get the same thing , and even if you &apos;re just going to get a little bit of help , if you <unk> children , kids can achieve very much . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone &apos;s doing it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve been able to think about the course of time , when you &apos;ve been asked me at the age of 15 years , i would have wondered how to my prostheses or legs made from meat and bones , i would have a second of <unk> .
i was going to be very normal at the time .
now , if you ask me this , i &apos;m not sure .
and this is what happens because i &apos;ve seen something with my legs and not despite that experiences .
and perhaps that change in the change also , because i &apos;ve been to see many people who have opened my doors , instead of having people who wanted to go to me or an idea of <unk> .
see , it &apos;s really just a person who demonstrate to you how to harness your powers and you &apos;re through .
if you give someone to <unk> your own , internal powers , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for somebody to open up a door , they &apos;re a very good teacher to open up .
they bring them to open themselves doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that means to produce the potential , to produce potential .
again , what potential is we want to do ? well ?
in the 1960s , in britain , they were transformed in the u.k. , then they were transformed <unk> into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are being pushed down .
and the one students will get <unk> harder , they get better teachers and so on .
they then have given over a <unk> period with a &quot; good &quot; the phrase &quot; very good , &quot; they were told , they were very clever , they were very clever , and after that three months they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it enables you to hear the heart that the other way that was said , it &apos;s only been sufficient .
and it was also the same way after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except for the students who had to get the school .
the very thing in this study was that teachers weren &apos;t <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed .
they simply said that were the <unk> and that is enough students with the bear enough , and they &apos;re treated them something and they &apos;re treating them .
the only real disability is a mind that was broken , no hope anymore . he finds nothing more <unk> than it is missing our natural , <unk> <unk> and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we can do it , to help the human mind , to continue to continue to continue to find yourself and other people around them , and then they &apos;re going to be able to be just a <unk> , and then we put our power positive .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can create new reality and create new organizational systems .
i want to talk to a poem , &quot; every child poet , who said only four words . &quot; &quot; the god of the god , not the god of the <unk> , but the god of the god , the god of the name , not the god of the <unk> , but god , who knows only four words and that constantly repeated them , and he &apos;s always saying , come , dance with me . &quot;
come and dance with me . thank you .
how would you be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , in few changes of genes , a better memory , could be more precise , more and faster .
or you want to be more mindful , more force , more force .
would you like to become more more attractive ?
how would it be like to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always going to go after more creativity .
which one would you like ?
what would you like to have , if you just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a few . probably , you know , a few , probably , as many as the creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to make a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say that , as a doctor .
if you could just have one of them , it would be a different world .
is this all a little bit of a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> subject to the ted , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s view .
the great <unk> in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make any sense except the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you are one of those who don &apos;t take the evidence of the biological evolution , you can take your personal returns , and maybe you can look at a <unk> <unk> <unk> book , which is being wrong , because nothing else over this talk is going to make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , remember this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people , or it &apos;s also for us ?
this is another view of life , and it &apos;s a look at the tree of life .
in this painting , i &apos;ve got a bush to the middle of the <unk> in the front , and if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the <unk> on the tops of these branches have success in evolutionary terms , they survived ; it &apos;s got to be independent and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re interested in is .
we branch in the branches of a common ancestor about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there were probably 20 or 25 different varieties of hominids .
some of them come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were right from the other parts of the tree tree of life , but actually , in the most , they &apos;re fundamental mechanisms to our cells quite equal .
is it clear that we can use to use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can create the protein of the human <unk> that is used to treat the <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s increasing <unk> of what &apos;s coming from the pancreas .
and in fact , we &apos;re talking about bacteria , is aware that each of us in our gut , is more bacteria than we &apos;re going to lead cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times a time .
i mean , think about the fact , if antonio damasio asks to the bacteria , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you might want to want to provide with no effort .
it &apos;s a easier way for bacteria , with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , forced by the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping <unk> food . and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen to the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> state in a form ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even even better to be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back a step back about this , maybe three trillion years ago -- the first <unk> of living organisms , maybe three billion years ago -- the first <unk> organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago , and then the human species that are starting to shape over the last <unk> years .
in this huge <unk> symphony of the universe , the universe is only about <unk> , the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that was us .
and this also turns out the <unk> of this talk , so i hope , and i &apos;ve got it to you that &apos;s going to have them like it .
now , when i was a <unk> , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i was thinking something very basic , in most of the lives of life , in <unk> organisms , can split every cell , and all the genetic information in the cell will continue to continue to grow .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms , they started changing things .
so , sexual reproduction is going to the picture .
and very importantly , with the advent of sexual <unk> , the genome is going to be <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death media in the same moment is when the sexual <unk> is reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , i thought , &quot; sex , death / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable to the time , but with each year , it &apos;s to my increased chance of <unk> .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , which was in las vegas that show his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on the <unk> at night .
he opens the door .
and it &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is a great &quot; say george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization of a doctor that i was going to show a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily , not necessarily , just unlike .
i tried to maintain the body .
i wanted to keep a healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted to make a long and live life .
evolution is all about the ability of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , you &apos;re and i &apos;ve developed as <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit , to drop it into the ocean .
i think we would all have mood that will understand the <unk> of all the way when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get through my work .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily necessarily have to be the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the most , the most , or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to the best of their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the reason that you are bacteria that are <unk> , the <unk> are the <unk> , and therefore the hot will remain the end of the mind , if you were the vacuum , you would have a vacuum <unk> of the product yet , you &apos;ve managed to make a <unk> environment .
so , what does that mean , if we think about what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and most of all , as we &apos;re going to <unk> into the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason that they were , first of all , in medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> and removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment so <unk> that we made it to be able to adjust it in us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander , and we mix so much that they can &apos;t say that they can &apos;t say that they &apos;re necessary to evolution , to <unk> .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of the traditional form , of course , being imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here , here would be that the wheels wheels on the evolution is slow down , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation is , if we &apos;re seeding the planet as a species , it will be undermining and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development isn &apos;t just natural , but also , and then , from us as a <unk> in the decisions we do .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s start looking at the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family is .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to prevent the body of genetic <unk> that would cure and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to make diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminating the lack of risk or stroke it ?
wouldn &apos;t they want to do that , to make these changes in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes are becoming more possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year when it was completed in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can give a sequence of three billion <unk> , the human genome , about 20,000 and a half of 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more long to the reality , to the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollar human genome , and it will be more and being available to everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering projects developed the natural process of evolution to evolution to work faster , faster , to <unk> proteins in a more more efficient manner -- which is called the <unk> institute of <unk> arnold .
a few years ago , the holocaust designer was awarded to the <unk> of the scientists who was an adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes that are throwing out to a <unk> cell , a cell potentially , potentially , can be able to become the body in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that makes human insulin to the bacteria that can make the difference that they don &apos;t just protect themselves , but also to the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the <unk> with vaccine , that &apos;s been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good that &apos;s coming from tobacco ?
this is all the reality and the future will be much more possible .
so , just imagine two different changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of the wing ?
what if they could change the sperm and <unk> or <unk> or <unk> the <unk> , to make your children a better chance to live a <unk> life -- eliminating diabetes , get rid of the <unk> , the risk of cancer ?
who would not want to be healthier ?
and then the <unk> technology , the same motor motor of science can make the change that could enable science to prevent disease , could we also provide <unk> <unk> , <unk> , better memory .
why don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> of a ken <unk> , especially if you extend it , the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that you can get to allow them to run faster and longer ?
why not live ?
these are being <unk> .
and if we are in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the capacity we &apos;re going to be able to be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that will possibly have 100,000 years of , and we can compress it into a thousand years , and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with those of their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to be able to deal with .
are we using these decisions a society that is better that is more successful , that &apos;s more friendly ?
or will we be selectively going to be selectively different from the <unk> that we want for some of us , and not for others of us ?
are we going to be able to create a society form and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we &apos;re going to have to meet .
and the deepest of all of all , we will ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom of the wisdom that we need to make this decisions ?
in good , like in evil , and early , as you might think , these decisions are decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine this now , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another , the <unk> help help stand up and go to go up and go .
we started with this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re not different than something that they will , and they &apos;re going to make the extra strength and keep the speed up and they will help them keep their balance .
this is indeed the true animal of human and machine .
but not just that -- so that we are doing with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldier , the average of about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s got the incentive to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help us cope with this problem .
so let me introduce you now to <unk> , or human universal <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds of <unk> , many hours , for hours .
his flexible design is allowing to be focused deep , to produce infinitely and highly <unk> .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go to go and increase my strength and mount .
we &apos;re far , with our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> of this year .
so it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s now take our look at the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m going to take a very miserable person to do for me .
there are 68 million people , who are now in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about a percent of population .
and that &apos;s indeed an conservative estimate .
we often talk about a lot of young people with spinal cord in the height of their life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- the fate was made and is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number has multiplied with .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a <unk> , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been 500 years , by the way , since the way i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you now , this is a <unk> , which is carried by amanda <unk> , who suffered a <unk> , which has been a result that they couldn &apos;t walk over and over 19 years .
thank you .
as i said , amanda wearing our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his fully <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is attached to their backs here .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as on their <unk> , which they move forward to this rather insidious and very natural ones .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> me .
a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and all motion underneath my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never get to go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel is about any <unk> hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been <unk> to learning , to climb skiing and even with the hands with the hands .
but nothing was invented , which was going to me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got the potential to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all the rest of the wheelchair , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a boss of the <unk> of a non-profit company called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> , a volunteer <unk> .
well , in our city , in the volunteer volunteer , you have to have supported a <unk> <unk> , you have to be very early on the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the <unk> , so i had to have a good opportunities to be able to .
but it was still a race to reach the <unk> and to find the <unk> of the <unk> of what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he was just in a very serious conversation with the <unk> who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the middle of the <unk> and <unk> under a screen in the <unk> , while your house was <unk> .
the other volunteers who arrived just outside me -- let &apos;s call him <unk> , &quot; the first time to go to go and get asked to save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was <unk> out .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who &apos;s now for the rest of his life that was going to tell people that he was going to go into a <unk> house to save a living thing , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next one .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up , and the fire goes over , and you have to get some shoes a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i &apos;m going to be , but i went down -- the stairs went up , and the stairs went up , the real <unk> over , which is the point that they were <unk> with , in the bedroom to get some shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking about , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom line , and the beloved dog hit .
we put our treasures out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , much more attention was more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> was a letter of the <unk> where they were going to be the brave action of their house in the rescue of their house .
and the most common level of kindness &apos; kindness : somebody even had a few shoes .
both of my career in the robin hood , as well as i was a veteran , i am a witness of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the rabbit and the unconscious of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people see that you can either have a <unk> success or on your way there , i want to offer you the following , please , don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to do a difference in life of another way , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give something , you &apos;ll give it right now .
if you use a park in a <unk> , you put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save lives of a person , but every day offers us the opportunity to change one .
so they put on . save it , save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to come back from a community that knows the secret of the suv of humanity .
a place where women are fighting the <unk> , with sex &apos; hi , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your blood .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungle in the congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relative .
that means we have a shared <unk> , an evolutionary grandmother , which was about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees , <unk> guys will run the <unk> of <unk> female .
they really came up with , because this leads to a very <unk> society , in the disease , the deadly force is not seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are known at the least .
they &apos;re living in the deep depths of the <unk> , and the observation is difficult to make it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary diversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the location of a violent argument that has been called for decades and almost so many lives have planned for the world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction are also the survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , you can &apos;t even have a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there &apos;s not secure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> smile that you can get <unk> .
who are these related ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have <unk> sex , including sex with <unk> partners and rules as conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life of bonobos are more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s essential for us to set relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn that we &apos;re trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about all the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobos , the evolutionary origins of human human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origins of this , &quot; it &apos;s got it in the <unk> . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like , right .
yeah !
so <unk> are spread , both with bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows the <unk> , which is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> where you &apos;re bringing new elements into the game -- like the testes -- and also , as the game is going to provide both trust as well -- while it &apos;s doing a lot of it .
but the game is a <unk> .
and play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of forms of people who are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to explore the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she &apos;s playing with water .
i think just like you play , and we &apos;re <unk> boundaries of our inner and the outside worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us <unk> , and interact and interact . and the unexpected we are producing , are the <unk> of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> on the insights that bonobos us in our past and present .
but it also has a secret to our future , a future where we need to adjust to change in increased challenges , through greater creativity and <unk> risk of cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these abilities is .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to adapt to a <unk> world , we need to play .
but will we make the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally equally , they don &apos;t have the teeth and they alone .
just if it seems to be , maybe the game is going to be on .
and so my favorite idea , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and playing together while we &apos;re going to embrace the creativity and the wonder of the <unk> .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , in the same time , the same day , every <unk> baby , okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> baby .
now i don &apos;t want to be able to spend too much of the time that the <unk> , because if you &apos;re going to imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case that <unk> a y <unk> , which is the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome that meets the x chromosome of the <unk> .
they &apos;re both <unk> , both of fire .
we &apos;re still going to get back to these people .
most of my activities , i have two hats .
i &apos;m going to be a hat with the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m an <unk> <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that means human body , animal bodies -- like <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , as you thought about body .
the other hat i &apos;ve been carrying at my work is the ones i carried with my work , the one is , as a <unk> -- or as i say , as a disabled man -- of people who are patients from doctors .
in this case i &apos;ve been working with people , who have <unk> , the social standards in question .
so i &apos;ve been working for example , with people who are twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than they were .
and i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , whose gender <unk> is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as general , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the kind of <unk> that &apos;s not the male or female .
in a case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> gene of y <unk> , the <unk> gene , the <unk> gene , we &apos;ve all <unk> , to defend up to the testes .
and so the testicles are on the <unk> stage testosterone .
but because that individual is the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no response .
as a result , the body evolves more and more of the typical female course .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually about until the puberty is reached and developing and developing , but you don &apos;t get your period until someone else is going to get a little different .
and they do some tests and find out that they were <unk> chromosome , instead of <unk> and uterus , actually <unk> and <unk> that they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that this person could hold and think of it , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that they have in our bodies , they call <unk> .
you &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> are <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i &apos;ve probably seen the typical of the typical -- most of the women i actually talk to <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that more <unk> was exposed to a woman who was born with <unk> and a <unk> .
and the sex is really complicated , <unk> , not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way , can you be distributed across the entire range of the spectrum of gender .
one example : a couple of years ago , i was born to call a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just found that he had <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosomes , and in the womb , his <unk> were so strong , that they have basically made a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> had been <unk> , his brain was subjected to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw how a boy , no one could see anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical issues , actually , because he &apos;s <unk> , that the doctors had found that he was in internal .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> for a kind of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called the <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that &apos;s happening .
so , gender , and so , in many different varieties .
the reason children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> twins , it was <unk> -- that surgeons often become adjusted to be adjusted for your physical health .
in many cases these people are completely healthy .
the reason why many ways of many surgeries are being done , is because they threaten our social categories .
so , we &apos;re actually going to be really based on the idea that certain anatomic experiences is being connected with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be a female identity , which is to be a black person , means that , is , an african anatomy , in terms of your story .
so we have this horrible <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different , and confused us , and i really confused this into terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture , and so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation really starts based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine , how did it be born when children are born , the two people are in a body .
and where i had been in most of the most exciting , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose gender of the <unk> world in berlin was asked .
a lot of journalists , i call me the question : &quot; what test will you do , which tells us whether <unk> <unk> female or a mate ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is a line between the male and female , or between the male and <unk> and female and <unk> ; we &apos;re going to have a <unk> that we have to say that , of course .
so we have a situation where the further our science is at science , we have to be able to say that these categories that were happening we &apos;ve been <unk> for robust truths , which is very easy <unk> to create permanent <unk> , much more favorable than we &apos;ve been .
and it &apos;s not just the relationship of gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which is much more complicated than our <unk> has been approved .
we have moved into all kinds of <unk> areas in our endeavor .
we push into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in common .
what shall we start with the fact that we just differ from few more <unk> ?
as we continue to continue our science moving forward , we &apos;re becoming increasingly in a <unk> zone , where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we probably had to be too simple .
we see that in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas that we see in our culture , in our culture today , is the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have tough conversations about what point a body to people , so he &apos;s right to have a different kind of fetal life .
we have very <unk> <unk> -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to be so hard to fight with the question when somebody was dead .
they just have a <unk> <unk> , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t yet buried .
if you don &apos;t move it , you have buried .
but today we are in a situation where we take people to take people organs and they want to transplant them .
and as a result , we get to fight ourselves with the fight of the really difficult question , when someone is dead . and that makes us a really difficult situation we don &apos;t have as simple categories as used .
now , you might expect that the entire thing was a <unk> of categories like a really happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , &quot; makes me . &quot;
and it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s thought of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i &apos;ve got to take a big fan of the fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and so radically , in which they did , i think i &apos;d like to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the <unk> .
the mushroom fathers were from my lens &apos;s <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they &apos;re doing was a <unk> concept , and they took it through another , radically and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our <unk> the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was on the ground in a very serious concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
and they were the notion that people who had political power , that political power should have , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> of grandfather to father and so on .
the founding fathers of the idea , and they took them through a new symmetrical concept , and this concept said that all people were being created .
they <unk> the field and decided that <unk> , they don &apos;t count the difference , and that was very radical .
now , they did this , because they were part of a <unk> system , in which two things together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science is .
if you look at the history of dads , you realize , many of you were very interested in science , and you were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from <unk> <unk> , and meadows , like a psychic concept of power , back back , where the transmission transmission is very <unk> , <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and then , as part of that , they were given us a concept that was <unk> .
and they really have prepared for a really wonderful way of civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about this , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened ?
for example , the <unk> of the <unk> , which tells you that there are more important in the anatomical direction , and they were not significant enough enough to make a difference , that we should not have the <unk> to have the right to complete the <unk> , to own the law of law , etc . , etc .
and women <unk> the successful .
and the next thing was the successful civil rights movement that we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> over it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , which is , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are different skin skin , who are affecting the anatomic respects of fewer <unk> , again , successful .
we see the same thing at the time .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we need to start to ask , to ask , why we maintain certain kinds of things .
well , you want to mind you , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should be taking away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to get informed consent or to marry .
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that make me make sense , and that we should , i think , should .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it &apos;s and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s get back to these two things that are beginning to start with <unk> .
we have two creatures , both of the middle 1979 , the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of <unk> , she &apos;s born on a june of the world .
<unk> , on the other hand , it &apos;s born to <unk> , so he &apos;s born on a march of march .
just because of the fact that maria &apos;s three months of <unk> , they get all kinds of <unk> three months before <unk> -- that &apos;s fairly <unk> sex , to choose to drink the right to drink .
<unk> has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has an individual biological age , only because of the <unk> of his birth .
we are still finding other ways of what their rights are .
<unk> , because you just think he &apos;s male -- although i &apos;m not told you that he &apos;s the mit <unk> -- because you just think he &apos;s male , he can now become a <unk> , which maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , in fact , can &apos;t be the same kind of <unk> , the <unk> in all states , and marry it right .
<unk> can only marry every state of a woman , but maria is to marry today in a few states .
so we have these permanently <unk> categories that are problematic <unk> in many ways , more problematic .
and for me , the question : what are we going to do , because our science is to make this progress in the anatomy , that we can reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy that could be based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like science is doing .
so where do we go ?
it seems to be a kind of pragmatic posture , like , &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we pull it anywhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get into a very strange position .
so for example , texas at a point decided that , to marry a man , you have no y chromosome , and a woman means you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are tested not to their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a solution .
he says we should not be color , but after the fact of their character , &quot; judge , and it &apos;s like that kind of anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do this in practice ?
how do you like to <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be <unk> rights to people so that i have to admit , i have to say that i know a series of golden <unk> that probably make a lot more likely to make than some people i know .
i want to argue that i &apos;m probably also seeing some bright <unk> , <unk> , more mature , more mature about sexual relationships than some <unk> that i know .
so how shall we put the question of the properties of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me wonder what would be if the contents of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- using an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is to be concerned about making democracy .
in our endeavor for democracy , we &apos;ve done really well right , and i think we would make our point in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as the one man who is being attracted to other men , is being attracted to death , it &apos;s because he &apos;s willing to be a <unk> operation in which he can stay alive .
states don &apos;t exist in this way .
i &apos;m glad we can &apos;t have this states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago , who had a few <unk> twins with himself to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was <unk> with him , and he asked why he made these <unk> -- it was highly <unk> surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , have you have a political asylum , instead of separate the operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide an incredible opportunity to allow people to be the ones that they are , without being able to change the state of state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to note that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of what democracy might look like , or looked like , if we had more involved in it .
and i want to say something that is radical , and i think that there may be different ways of insight that could be different kinds of anatomy , <unk> , if people use a <unk> system .
i &apos;ve been interested in the field of <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in the field of <unk> , i also , myself .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways to think about how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies , that women , average -- not every one -- more than average -- more often complex social relationships and care of people who are vulnerable within the group , very much attention to give .
and so , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
and i was going to show a graduate student when i was an graduate student , i was thinking of my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so it &apos;s still -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what was a female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s feminism , at the feminism , is nothing to be female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there could be some <unk> in the feminism .
this is hot , it could be something in the average , and the female brains of male different minds of male different social relationships is power and <unk> for the <unk> .
so , as the founding fathers could be protected , and as individuals who could protected , it &apos;s possible that if we could have more moms in this concept , we have more a concept of not just how you protect , but how we can do for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go to the future , if we have to go to democracy about anatomy -- less about individual bodies think of what identity is to think about the relationship of connection and more thinking .
so that , if we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got to do , i &apos;m going to make a very positive confession , and that &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> .
i love to be a different <unk> , <unk> tool , to wear <unk> and to photograph and to be blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy any new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand , and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment , and my wallet also .
i &apos;m making all kinds of great people , my dollars to be used for a good purpose ; i &apos;m pretty unique from ; and it does something like my personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
is it my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
is it going to be less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought .
i brought seven few <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly a week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve got a bet that i might have to be anything i would like to find , find , if i was going to go to palm springs .
and since you &apos;ve been hearing from me , the woman here at ted in her underwear -- is that , i found a few things .
and i &apos;m really going to show you my favorite <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
and while i do this , i &apos;ll also leave you some of the lessons that i &apos;m going to tell you , whether you believe it or not , from that <unk> , i &apos;ve learned to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the purple tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good .
you &apos;re almost always great to look at less than 50 dollars .
this whole kind of outfit , including the coat , 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad at the time , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;ll find other happy people .
tuesday : <unk> is totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time my life to try and adapt to the same time .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you don &apos;t just get it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your own child .
sometimes i say i would say i would look like i &apos;m playing &apos; games or i remember her .
i love and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good in something good , it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think you &apos;re not very good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me a day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just wrap this short for you .
if you believe that you are inside and the outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse anyone here in this audience .
we should be able to do anything that we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> meets .
and finally , saturday : a own unique style of design , is a great way to tell the world something about a story without having to say a word .
and it was always proven to me , and over again , when you get people to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll give it all back to you .
because the lesson i &apos;ve learned about trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
i don &apos;t have to be very emotionally <unk> , because the right around the road will always have to be a different kind of crazy , <unk> , <unk> tool , just to just wait for me if i love a little bit and search for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody combined .
i have something i want to show you .
think this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you is this , which was something that &apos;s happened in the past several decades .
some of a time ago , it was like a formula for a race , then they took their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car was good enough , the driver would be good enough , then they won the race .
now , now , if you want to win a race , something like this -- something that &apos;s been <unk> in real time , some thousand sensors that are <unk> the information , and then you can then use it and then use it and use this to send the car to send back to the car and you can change things in real time .
this would you , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> portion and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that the problem is beginning to be <unk> in our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , are now equipped with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
and as computers in the free , they start to respond to other ways , they are perceived and <unk> .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention cities only only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world population live there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- causing to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something to the cities , this is a big deal .
and beyond the cities , pull all of this sense and drive in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that is liberal antonelli in the year , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; so that . &quot;
now all of our objects , our environment , are starting to speak .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom is out to two , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is transforming the interaction that we have to people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when a veteran of the moses , it means that he took the hammer , and he &apos;s still got a little bit of a <unk> <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins for the first time , to respond to the answer .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to make the idea of changing our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to show you is one of the first of our labs .
and it was born over four and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually this one of the network that was used to use the network of the network that was used to be used -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and anonymous and <unk> information is to use information from this network that would be collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was as italy was going to be a <unk> .
some of you will remember it was like italy to france , and then the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
no matter , italy has won at the end .
now you see what happened to this day , just in the activity of activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
on the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up the timeline .
the first afternoon , people here , and there , the phone calls are actually making and move .
and the game starts to mention -- silent .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to the bathroom .
second <unk> . end of normal .
first , second , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in that night , everyone went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big one .
the next day , all the way to go to the center to meet the prime minister of the prime minister .
and then all the <unk> .
you see the image of the space <unk> <unk> , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to go to a big party , and they see the most important thing that day .
now , this is just one example , as we could feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it in front of a few years ago .
so quick , for example , is not about people , here it &apos;s about people , but to things we use and consume .
well , today we know about where our things are coming .
this is a map which shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage while it &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with a few volunteers , we &apos;ve helped us to tag a little bit more than a year , in seattle , in seattle , and the things that they &apos;re doing -- different kinds of volunteers that they would see , things like you can see -- things that would be throwing away .
then we have the little chips , the small brands , to track it and started to track it and started to track it .
here &apos;s the results we have just gotten .
so , from seattle ...
after a week .
and this information that we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things that actually do with less energy .
the data was not available .
but this is happening a lot of <unk> <unk> and complicated things .
the other thing , but that , if we see every day we &apos;re seeing , the cup that we throw away is not just disappearing , that you still have anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle , we still throw away every day .
and if we would show that people , we can drive a change change .
so that &apos;s why for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you see a lot more about the sense of it , and that &apos;s the most amazing things that you can do with you , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;ve initially talked about , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain spain .
it started with a question of <unk> who came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a nice tradition , to use public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you get technology to new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were in a <unk> <unk> , and they were providing these tubes , and the valves , <unk> , valves , open and close .
they &apos;re creating what like a <unk> with <unk> water .
if these <unk> fall down , you can write about it , you can make patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;ll be open to open up to <unk> you as you can see on this picture .
well , we &apos;ve launched the mayor of <unk> .
it really fell very like him .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the entrance to the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the entire building was out of water .
there &apos;s no doors , or windows , but if you approach it , it &apos;ll open and let it go .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s been enough , if you want to cut the box , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , you know , this day , if you &apos;re <unk> the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve got the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just so that architecture is almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what happens .
and here you see me , when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not to get wet .
well , i should tell you what happened to one night when all of the sensors .
but actually it was more fun in this night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open up to be a building , but a building that would still be sucking and <unk> and holes in the water , you had to jump to the <unk> .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people do , the people that we design .
but the reality is always an unpredictable .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are used to be used and interact with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections on it .
and this is what makes us think about this project , which i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that these <unk> could actually start flying .
imagine you could have a little helicopter , you know , you have a little bit of the air , and each of you with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter like the ones you saw earlier , it &apos;s totally synchronicity .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or an ad , like this -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , where what changes light is not the position of the <unk> .
you can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just be able to appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different parts of it .
but then this could only be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can walk and go through and move them through the way that you can look from many , many directions .
this is a real <unk> , which is <unk> to form a <unk> v .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this , so that &apos;s how we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being controlled .
it could have every single one that could have a impulse that comes from people , from the motions of humans or something .
i want to show you something about this .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the <unk> theater in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d <unk> to use them as a impulse to use the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dancing .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can feel the whole movement .
they can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have <unk> , you can play with it and play with color motion and <unk> .
we want to be able to use a possible amount of momentum for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we work on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , imagine that , again , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do to change people with something and environment -- almost as something we call , <unk> , how to move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one can give a donation for a <unk> .
i think that &apos;s remarkable remarkable over the past several years , the last few decades , is that we are changing from a physical to a digital world .
and that has all been consistent , and it makes it available through the internet .
today , we can take the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown that -- can we change the digital world , from the digital forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us the challenges , and think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we shift from the digital world to the physical change .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with the engage in which they &apos;re collectively doing .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same ways , like a real cloud of particles , is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud cloud from <unk> .
it &apos;s an physical physical object in london , but with <unk> .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from underneath , which are most important moments for <unk> 2012 and more than the way that connection to community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something about the top you can go to , like , in london new <unk> .
you can go into .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for all the experience that want to go to the top .
thank you .
and the artist is really important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to say that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was about to antarctica , almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
i was looking for awe .
my heart <unk> , while i was trying to grab what was going on .
the <unk> around me is almost about 60 feet from the water , and i was just able to just wonder that the snowflake was on another snowflake year , year after year .
<unk> are born to a <unk> or by <unk> out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact in a clear way with their surroundings and experiences .
some rebel , give up and <unk> to the bitter end , whereas other it can &apos;t stand more and <unk> into a <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you &apos;re going to be isolated , apart and alone , quite as we see humans .
but the truth is removed from it .
while a <unk> swims , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> drinking water , which is a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go back to my footage that <unk> , as if i make portraits my ancestors , in the consciousness that , that they exist in these individual moments of that way , and never again become so .
it &apos;s not death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s a <unk> of your <unk> edges .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last couple of paintings i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i &apos;ve developed in <unk> .
rarely , you actually inhabit a <unk> iceberg .
here &apos;s what it &apos;s looking at .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it &apos;s about 120 feet of water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , you show a different side of its personality .
thank you .
my life is really quite blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i ever worked on was the way that i &apos;ve ever been in , and it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from running , and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak of the war .
<unk> is completely paralyzed .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood across it .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so i &apos;m inevitably a bit more complicated part of what we admire in the world of art and looking for .
so we decided to support tony -- to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we will give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him and i asked , &quot; wait a minute , that &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be <unk> people using these devices using these devices ? &quot;
and he replied , &quot; no , only if you heard to higher <unk> and have an amazing insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how does you communicate ?
did anybody see the movie &quot; <unk> and <unk> &quot; ?
so they communicate , they &apos;re walking along .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came with the need , just just a check and i asked a check that i couldn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i should <unk> it .
i was committed to place and i ask his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is to talk : tony &apos;s going to talk about a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art back .
because it &apos;s a delicacy that somebody who is all of this stuff that can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i was talking about a conference several months later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then to draw a <unk> on the one that &apos;s just the negative surface .
they &apos;re like , and they make <unk> like this .
they say all the things that are displayed up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , then the <unk> and the final , are actually making art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and i was going to tell her , and i was thinking about this technology , which you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that can be able to steer a laser , so that he can make a graffiti back and make it back together , that would be awesome . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of the time , and i &apos;ve done some things about things .
first , we &apos;ve got the <unk> the doors , and actually , in fact , for a machine that he can communicate with that -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really really extremely funny -- i call it <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and it turns out , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers from all the world -- literally , from all the corner of the world -- to us , to us .
my wife , my kids and i pulled into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid , and that we were <unk> and all the images on the walls , they would be nice to <unk> .
but for over two weeks we program , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and some things out of the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they &apos;ve got <unk> , they have a <unk> , they have a <unk> board , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it , we &apos;re making the code for free , the software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constraints .
no insurance can be <unk> .
it &apos;s not a hospital .
now , every <unk> can actually be able to communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> from the great unveiling in the great unveiling .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony went back to seven years after the first time .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s seeing his life support system .
we &apos;ve gone down to the bed so that it can see .
we put a <unk> on a wall of the <unk> .
and he drew back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
so , we had to go into the parking lot of <unk> , so we felt about a part of the <unk> .
and at the end , he sent us an email with the following content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i have drawn something .
i feel that i was getting down underwater , and finally , somebody went down and my head and my head and i could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
and that &apos;s keeping us to stick and continue to continue to continue to continue to continue .
and we have to improve a lot of that device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s coming to a <unk> .
and somebody who has such a memorable potential , makes it so much more .
so we &apos;re looking at the way you better , faster and stronger .
since that time we &apos;ve gotten all sorts of recognition .
we won a few awards .
think about it &apos;s free , none of us .
it &apos;s all coming from our pockets .
so the <unk> were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , we &apos;ve been honored by the <unk> of the 50 best inventions that was really cool .
the <unk> is -- and that includes all of the circle -- that it was , in the <unk> <unk> , in the inner-city of los angeles an exhibition is called &quot; the kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there are probably the hardest of the most profound representatives of the <unk> expressway that his -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty much .
so i &apos;m going to be , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , that microphone -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had to do something with <unk> , but i &apos;ve just got a little bit around and i &apos;ve been surrounded by amazing people so we could put together something together .
and this question , everybody should ask you and that &apos;s every single day , to you , you have to do something that needs to be done , if not , when you &apos;re not , and if not i , who ?
thank you .
so i &apos;m writing for kids , and i &apos;m probably probably america &apos;s most <unk> .
and i always say to people i don &apos;t want to get a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever voted in the farmer .
today , i want to tell you about circles and all of us .
well , there &apos;s a enlightenment to usually be something that you find , because you have left it somewhere .
you go to the block and it &apos;s just taking it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has made it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in <unk> , ohio in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one that every week in the <unk> green and blue was beaten , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the <unk> .
they did .
it did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was <unk> me to san francisco , california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it really important to do a work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , woman who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m a sad thing to be known as adults .
please come to ohio , and please come along with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it .
and i should say that i &apos;ve got a <unk> , and i want you to go back . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we were doing , and we gave ourselves to their family , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew about .
and just as the woman who was learning as adults , i was to know , turned out into a box and was carried in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle , and the revelation i spoke about .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my mate and i &apos;ve saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this was often mentioned today .
it needs the same way -- it needs to be like , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a great explosion , as it goes on 1,000 feet to rise .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a power , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds frightening <unk> .
well , i had a unique space on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak to the <unk> .
so i looked at her right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve gotten some birds . &quot;
the pilot had a machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the machine for the hudson river .
that &apos;s not usually route .
he switches it &apos;s going down .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the effect . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> anymore .
i could see it in her eyes , because horror was the end of the end .
i want to share three things that i &apos;ve learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment it &apos;s all different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do , and i didn &apos;t do it , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences i was going to do and never made .
and as i was thinking about this , i thought to one , which is , &quot; i &apos;m not collecting bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is far , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move more to life .
and this urgency , this goal , my life really changed .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we learned the george washington bridge , so rather around <unk> -- i thought , &quot; man , there &apos;s one thing i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and my mind , i would get better to become better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego space .
and i &apos;m <unk> the time i &apos;m wasted <unk> things with people who mean something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and then , when i thought about it , i decided to ban the negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i couldn &apos;t get my wife for two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right , i have to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and as the internal clock <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please shred in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from the picture .
while we were <unk> , i had this feeling , man , not dying .
almost like we &apos;re preparing for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and these sadness <unk> are really in a mind , which is that i just wish to do a wish .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
so a month after that , i went to a show of my daughter -- <unk> , not much more nuanced talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i cry like a little baby .
and in the world , everything began to make sense of me .
i was realized at the time , by the beginning , i connected the dots , that it only only is a great parent .
more than anything , all my father is to be a good parent .
i was not introduced the miracle of <unk> in this day .
i got another gift , and i come back and see in the future and to live different .
my call to all of you who are flying today is : imagine that the same thing happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it ; how would you change ?
what would you do , which you get in , because you think you &apos;re always for ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can just be ?
thank you .
and the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is quite straightforward .
we don &apos;t want to build iran to build the bomb .
the most important place there is the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the <unk> boxes , you see that are <unk> .
now , if it &apos;s working at the time that the systems are to control , which is <unk> and the valves , we can actually get a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these <unk> boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , an effective <unk> is used to a laptop , which is used by a <unk> system to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will go into gray box , damage the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s a piece of cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we began our research to <unk> six months ago , completely unknown , and purpose that was the purpose of this .
the only thing we knew about is very complicated , which is the most important part , the <unk> part , it made made by <unk> <unk> of all kinds of <unk> .
and it seemed something that appeared to be coated with these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we were infected our environment with <unk> , and we looked at this construction .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> <unk> is like a <unk> machine that doesn &apos;t like to do -- <unk> it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made no sense of my eyes .
and after we had done different kinds of cheese , i went on to be a <unk> attack .
completely , in a particular target .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the gray box , if one particular program was discovered , even if this special program that it &apos;s trying to get to get the target .
and if not , then nothing is not .
so , the point really , i really got my interest and we started working on the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power plant , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> , we found out the <unk> code and found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads is <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very <unk> designed by people who have obviously all had to have all the <unk> information .
they had any bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
you know , you know , even the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech is , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this magnificent code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like an <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make it smart from this code .
so , for what we were looking for first , <unk> <unk> , because we know what that do .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring this with the real world -- potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we can take or <unk> .
to make these theories , we call ourselves that it definitely is <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be iran in iran , because most of these infections were reported .
well , in this field , there &apos;s not several thousand targets .
it &apos;s basically , out on the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i bring a list of all the experts in the <unk> and solar power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> her knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring us to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor there is a moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you &apos;re rigged this <unk> , you actually get able to crack the <unk> and then even get able to put the <unk> into it .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was slowly and <unk> to get <unk> , so that they couldn &apos;t get to be able to get behind .
the big digital enterprise -- we got a window of , by looking at the very precise and <unk> .
so for example , the number <unk> are very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started with science literature , which is how these <unk> built in <unk> and found that they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , put it together .
and it &apos;s been better .
these <unk> in iran are broken into 15 means of the levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost exactly exactly the same structure .
so again , this fits really well together .
and this gave us great confidence for us to study here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that way .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
and often we ran just a <unk> and we had to go to new .
but anyway , we found that both digital backgrounds are actually on a and the same target , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the height and slowed down and down the big <unk> , with six degrees of <unk> and <unk> that are associated with .
so , in large , and all we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually have to have what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be made by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- made me really made me out of the socks .
there &apos;s gray box and the top of you can see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is that is that the forces of sensors -- so for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it provides <unk> code that &apos;s still on the attack , with false powers , it &apos;s going to be .
and actually this false data is taken from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like <unk> , where during the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to be fed by the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
and the idea of this is obviously not just , the <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to be a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human genome can &apos;t respond to you very quickly enough .
so in a power plant , for example , if the big <unk> is going to quickly , you have to open your <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so , so , in this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if the risk are at the risk , really , really bad things happen .
power power is explode .
and neither the <unk> , the more <unk> it will notice .
this is frightening .
but it &apos;s getting worse than worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so it would work for example , for example -- in a power station or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the predators -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> stick over a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it in the <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you end up with a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the implication that we have to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the most egalitarian environments .
we have to ask ourselves , and we &apos;re getting better prepared for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much of it that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s the <unk> involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most basic superpower .
there &apos;s only one and the united states -- fortunately , happiness .
because otherwise , our problem would even even bigger .
thank you for letting us go through a <unk> . thanks ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years to place myself in situations that normally are very difficult and kind of dangerous dangerous at the same time .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been shot in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i &apos;ve spent 30 days of the time , nothing like this -- getting over here -- getting a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have been exposed to the most part of my career in <unk> situations , and it &apos;s all <unk> for trying to study social , and so that &apos;s what makes them <unk> and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes them fun and accessible to the audience and accessible .
so when i knew i was going to come here to come up in a tedtalk , the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something very little different .
some of you may have heard that i had an ad on ebay .
i sent a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> at my tedtalk in 2011 .
and , really , some lucky people , and companies , <unk> and <unk> , they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson never got to buy -- the <unk> of the talk you &apos;re going to see , which is not a title , and not many of the evidence that the subject would actually be .
so what you got was , my tedtalk , who you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and the one of the people who will fly in the <unk> to fly the ears , especially if i give her company to appear for their own stupid .
but it &apos;s still , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
despite this warning , i knew anyone would buy the <unk> .
now , if you had asked me this a year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this to say this .
but in the new project that i work , my new film , is we investigate the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going to make a pretty terrible situation over the years , but nothing could get me ready , nothing could be made me , and so dangerous as you could go to a room with these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , using the whole film , by <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film will <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that everything is going to end up , from the beginning to the end , totally with a <unk> -- from the <unk> you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand of the <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people are being connected to the film -- for always .
and so the movie will examine this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more appropriate .
it was &quot; eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have a brand of the brand of x as a <unk> , but we &apos;ll certainly imagine that we will sell any possible category in the movie .
we might sell a shoe and he will be the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever carried .
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever been threats , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink you ever have , a awareness of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides , you know , a part of the life , is actually , to finance the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all of the movie is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole movie , from beginning to end .
and i would love to help me get this into the <unk> , to get this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be more stereotypical people .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle , &quot; because that &apos;s got an awful <unk> -- but you know , how that &apos;s going to happen ?
how much money is required to do that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth any worth of a really familiar tool .
who knows if the movie comes out , we might see a <unk> of <unk> .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably going to be very much .
but is it a tough thing about the movie or a tough thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people who have to do it .
there are some places we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to run a <unk> .
it turned out that it meant in reality , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so , all of these companies , one of them disappeared .
no one wanted to have a film to do with the movie .
i was astonished .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising was your product as many people as possible , so many people can see as possible .
especially in the world today , in this intersection of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape , it &apos;s not the idea of being able to be exciting to be <unk> in this new <unk> that is the mass of the mass .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the one .
in fact , no , no , the error was not .
that would be no problem .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you look transparency at the <unk> , this is one of the first images that &apos;s been out .
i really like , you know , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- <unk> of deception and <unk> , just to explore and <unk> ; <unk> from <unk> and the access to information , especially what &apos;s wrong -- the last line is certainly the most problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , even our ceos say it , even our ceos will say .
but if it comes to the case that it &apos;s supposed to be done , it changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear <unk> -- like this strange bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is a risk ?
a whole <unk> cool <unk> .
this is a very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and i started talking to them , we wanted to tell them that story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and i sit at lying -- and there he sits and look at this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so , you see , you know , with this movie , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only a company that was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s also because i was a company , and i found that , because i know john bond and richard <unk> for years , i realized i had to go alone , i had to go to the <unk> and right to my team to the companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a <unk> problem .
i have friends who do big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends who are little <unk> .
and my friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , say that the reason your films are so successful at the point of the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , make , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how do we see a menu in the movie ?
whenever i open up the way , and always when i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see a <unk> <unk> .
and every time i &apos;m <unk> , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you like , you see a little bit nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should have a little bit of this interview , a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; they will have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well as women , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer your questions and give you a <unk> version .
we &apos;re a <unk> brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as a brand of a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a <unk> for the other brands .
so these things are going to do -- you know , remembers people in a row -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe to describe ?
you &apos;re <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
woman : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that would be someone under the <unk> .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category makes a positive power , unlike &quot; fight odor and humidity . &quot;
it &apos;s holding you fresh .
how can we hold it more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times three times .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the road , which are like me , <unk> .
i want to tell you something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , your brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to have nice clothes .
woman : &apos; 80s , in <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what is your brand ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i &apos;ve got , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and so stuff .
but i normally have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such stuff .
woman : if dan would be a brand , it &apos;s probably a classic <unk> of <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
two : part of the <unk> , yogi , in 1954 , in <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> throughout the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : the brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that going to be ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we cannot all be the <unk> , but i often look at the intersection of the interface glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> helped to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for the thing , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit like how to think about how to think and emotions are connected to you .
these are the people that my worldview shape .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the rest of the world is the world that you live in -- like people are around , the friends , the family , the way you live in life , the work and so .
all of these things come from and start from a place for me and i start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to talk about you .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of the mind and feelings about it ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are kind of weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you get us ?
what is the <unk> ? where are you going to have a little bit of ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
and so , what else is they going through ?
... that &apos;s not fear . in which kind of rollercoaster ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for the time .
yeah . now . now good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be .
there was a lot of crazy things that went out .
the first thing i saw was that , that their <unk> are two separate , but <unk> sides -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand .
the <unk> is very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are only going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies are often , and this is the human nature -- that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to be afraid , and that they &apos;re saying to be the welcome , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what else else does do ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , leds , mini <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
now , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , how would you like ?
you &apos;re making them a <unk> ? are you going to get your blood <unk> ?
or are you more likely to have a <unk> ?
are you something that is a little bit of quiet , more conservative , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , profane , <unk> , magic and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are you , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate , compassionate ?
are you <unk> , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and wise , like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
and over the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , which were up and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they were not going to be part of the project .
they wanted to do this movie , because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but , 17 <unk> , who were willing to get the control of these control , which was ready to give you the <unk> , and then , and finally , to tell us stories , stories that we don &apos;t normally have to support -- stories that would never support a <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> to tell us the story of the <unk> , so how we tell the story about the <unk> , that you &apos;re using today <unk> to make the <unk> of the brain , both to make advertisements as well as movies .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> were banned .
the entire city has been stuck in the entire city since five years , no poster , no poster , no <unk> .
and we drove in school school where companies are going to go to <unk> schools in the country .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are where i &apos;m going to compute with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies might not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist right .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people will think of thinking about our view of view .
and how did that for you ? what &apos;s it ?
now , since the movie film film had posted the last time , we can look at this .
and according to the <unk> , the first time in january was the first time in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this movie .
this is actually just a time of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be .
there &apos;s no <unk> online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s still not out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not a project that almost every <unk> , with which we talked about , their customers , to let the fingers .
something that i &apos;m sure is that if you take your opportunity to take risks , you &apos;re taking advantage of these risks .
i think if you leave people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think if you were practicing your employees to avoid hazards , you have to have a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to do risk of risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear that they might be <unk> .
finally , we should be afraid to be the fear of hot .
we should put the bear in the cage .
hot to fear . embrace the risk .
each one is a very big <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to welcome the risk .
and finally , we should embrace transparency .
today , more than ever , it takes us a little bit more honesty .
and this is , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; it &apos;s welcomed &quot; to welcome them from my good friends of <unk> , who paid for $ <unk> for ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations in the world for the world .
<unk> : &quot; hot them transparency &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , the name of transparency is this : what is right now with a <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket a check , put on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in altitude of <unk> to finance my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago , i made something different at google , and i &apos;m <unk> to make it something with museums and art , and my favorite one , which is today , i gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> <unk> and stories , i can tell you , 17 , very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal point is very easy with this slide and to explain to you .
i grew up in india .
i was in a great training -- i didn &apos;t get my -- but i had no access to many museums and i don &apos;t have access to this art .
and when i went to visit and visit these museums , i started learning a lot of learning .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this desire -- art , to do with technology .
we then <unk> a team , a great crew , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around all of these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m actually in one of my favorite ones , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get two because of it -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and <unk> .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in it they &apos;re in , they want to end in the end of the office .
just keep . much fun .
take a look forward .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so now i &apos;m a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us , it &apos;s going to click on it .
this is one of the images .
this is all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i click this right now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve taken with the so-called <unk> .
so this image , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can easily do it in and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is to be .
but then they really want to get deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i found that there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the way , and i realized that these kids actually put together .
i worked a little bit , talking about met some of the known , and found out that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , where a passenger player was being knocked with a stick .
it seems to be fairly popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and to go really close to the way you can go to the anesthesia .
just to give you a <unk> , i &apos;ll find you to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
and the previous example , was about finding some details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see van gogh this masterpiece to be built ?
you put in it . you can really go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my <unk> this image , until i &apos;m really immersed in the cracks .
this is <unk> , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there &apos;s still a lot more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the world &apos;s collections .
each of you , everybody -- same if you have rich or poor you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and online your own museum -- all of these pictures can make you own your collection .
just simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can get it with you , you &apos;re sending your friends , and i &apos;m going to start with what you feel like these masterpieces .
i think , finally , is the main thing that &apos;s the main thing that all of the wonderful things here is not coming from here .
they come from my mind , it &apos;s not going to come from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and this was a experience for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be with this digital medium of art , and it &apos;s just about online online .
and this is the biggest question that i recently asked to do , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side is .
if we could have a scale to measure the hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this one would be a little bit of a sense .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you <unk> your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to be one of these extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> <unk> that looks like in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both of them or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see one of the people , in conjunction with the most other experimental <unk> that takes a good share of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but the same time we need a good share of intuition to actually carry the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and play it and look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition here .
basically , they do the same .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing is going to be just in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can make strange sounds to think that one thing at the same time in two different locations , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember playing a child playing on a <unk> .
he was a toddler and not very good at it , and he fell constantly .
but i bet that the games of the <unk> is a very valuable lesson , which is the big thing you don &apos;t just leave you over , and that you &apos;re staying in place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long you don &apos;t have a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and when you play your particles , you can imagine all kinds of weird things that are very , like , just like you &apos;re directly able to fly directly , or you can get to two different places .
and so they just wrote up all of these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
and that was the one that was the physics of a few years ago ; you took quantum mechanics to describe the little particles , you know , describe .
but you don &apos;t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
this has not liked my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t have any kind of particle games .
well , i &apos;m sorry sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side has not liked it .
because if all things are made of particles , and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , then not simply anything to follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it should not be so .
so i would love to be better with the whole thing if we could kind of show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , i did just to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was <unk> in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is what i &apos;m going to zoom in . we &apos;re looking at this right here .
and here &apos;s a really very big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s like a springboard and it &apos;s about the edge over .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer with a computer .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> <unk> , <unk> hole and getting the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it needs a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know , how lame it is to be a full passenger plate ?
i mean , if i &apos;m on the robes alone , i &apos;m making all kinds of weird things to do , but then other people , and i &apos;ll get to all these things , because i don &apos;t want them to let them , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just as comfortable .
the <unk> for most competitive objects are not just people , but the light that appears to you and the wind that &apos;s over to you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal behaves <unk> , we had to go all the <unk> out of the <unk> .
and we did that .
we turned the light off , put it into a vacuum and <unk> the entire air and <unk> it up to almost , on the elevator , all alone , was the piece of metal , and behavior like it always wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found it really , really , really weird .
instead of just being quiet , it &apos;s <unk> it , and the way it was <unk> was like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could get it to vibrate at the same time , not to vibrate -- something which is allowed to do quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is , what is truly fantastic .
what does it mean for a object for the same time and not putting it into disappointment ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first fall : all of the <unk> of atoms from the piece metal is still there and the same time moving the same atoms and off .
just too precise <unk> voices , you agree .
the rest of the time is <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time in two different locations is what is that at the same time , that &apos;s the whole piece of metal in two different locations .
i think that &apos;s cool .
really .
it was worth all of this for all this year , for all this year , because , you know , the <unk> between a single atom and the piece of metal is about as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different locations , that piece of metal in two different places , why not they &apos;re doing it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side is saying .
so imagine you &apos;re at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would you deal with consciousness that your body is <unk> in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of it .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact only are <unk> objects that are together in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics is that everything is connected to everything .
now , this isn &apos;t quite right .
there &apos;s more than it , it &apos;s still more .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their ties with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and this is the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families want to think about where they live and work , they want to be the possibility of being able to pick up a hand between at least one hand full of different cities that are all standing in the competition to be new <unk> .
we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world , which is not even a single city of the <unk> that they would say to be hot .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more worth of building them .
so we could just <unk> the world with <unk> , perhaps even hundreds of new cities .
this may seem easier for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
trade it is just going to take the construction from apartments against the city of cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , they did not have half the other half .
they could try to extend the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you would like to get into that , in these homes and their surroundings , laws laws and avoid the law of <unk> and <unk> .
so it turns out , it turns out , and it &apos;s very hard to keep all of these extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place , a fully new building block , if the laws would support a building like that , and it &apos;s not being <unk> .
so i suggested that governments create new spaces that are able to create enough space for a city and have given them a name : <unk> cities .
and then later , i found that , for example , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> , over the challenge of reform , have thought about reforming .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 <unk> , they were leaving to the united states to <unk> the country to <unk> the united states to <unk> the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in constant .
and then , if you want to work in the <unk> area , what happens if we &apos;re just going to go to a message of the <unk> <unk> or the united states , you can do it in the country , and you can do the united states , you can work there , and you can work there on the surface of these messages , what would you usually have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , cyclone <unk> was under a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> taniyama won <unk> in a shift that program has been evolving and innovation and <unk> .
he was asked to become <unk> .
meanwhile , i was going to have been a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , try and study consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city , which is basically the elements of the <unk> city .
the first point is , the importance of law , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have to be able to withstand any of the existing world .
we give the new technologies to pay attention , but for progress , it needs the technologies and the law , and it &apos;s usually the laws that help us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala came to the <unk> .
and then , this was <unk> .
the two rings me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we came up with a hotel in december , the <unk> of a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make a clear way , as valuable cities are , to how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable <unk> is to a place like new york , and think about it , that one area in some cases per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a kind of abstract discussion , at a point when there was a break , and i said , &quot; paul , could we even look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form , that a <unk> city is a place that defines the laws that govern there and the people who have the opportunity to decide either either of those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we need to realize this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that we &apos;re going to get anywhere .
i was asked to come to <unk> and even the fifth of a talk , and i was going to end up the talk .
so i &apos;ve given a few <unk> talk , which has been trying to make a chart like this , which has tried to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and the sketch is a new airport that was built in <unk> .
by the airport , it &apos;s got a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> of that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
they &apos;re all polite .
the audience of the audience were very serious and alert .
the head of congress came up to the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you , thank you for your talk , but could we see the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch note that a new city gives people new possibilities .
it would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in honduras , instead of miles away from north miles away .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government would be made from <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> that they would be able to support the laws of this charter and to allow everybody to trust that charter will really be taken .
and the insight from president <unk> was that the fact that the <unk> i was thinking about is that the <unk> of the <unk> i was thinking about being a way to get the <unk> investors to build this city for a lot of years , which has been under fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this is the picture of this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , the 19th of january , you have given congress to change the constitution , to have a <unk> rule that &apos;s for special <unk> .
in a country that &apos;s just a ferocious crisis , in which congress was elected for these <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
but to be part of the constitution , it needs to be authorized twice by the congress .
on the 17th , it was authorized to be a second time to <unk> with a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , traveled from about 30 <unk> of the world that were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
the place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new core center , built <unk> in south korea , and it &apos;s a big picture of <unk> .
everything you see on this picture was built within four years , and then after four years took to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in the very most , singapore .
it &apos;s been built two cities in china , and the third is preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s like to stand today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> ; and you &apos;re just looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a law that &apos;s been going to be allowed to participate , and it &apos;s been working on an external legal system .
country has already offered to provide his supreme court , for the <unk> approval of the <unk> system .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even provide funding with a .
one thing you already know , has been realized , there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
there are lots of businesses that would like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are lots of people who would like to live there .
over the world , there are 700 million people , who report that they would like to live in a different location .
a million people left a year of america and migrate to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to be forced to work to work on their own , and they &apos;re single mothers who have to earn enough money to eat and have to do it .
unfortunately , it &apos;s even kids who are trying to find their parents back in some cases , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen more than a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about it , in a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of the world &apos;s around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in the competition to be new <unk> ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends &apos; party asked me to say , thank you .
do you know how many decisions you do about a typical day ?
do you know how many choices are making in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently done a survey over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that would be a typical person &apos;s typical person &apos;s typical person &apos;s typical .
and also , recently , a study of the study of ceos was made a week of the ceos .
and these scientists have documented the different topics that have been doing this , and they &apos;ve been doing this , and how much time they make a living decisions that are related to the issues .
and they found that an average enemy , they &apos;re doing with <unk> tasks .
each of these issues was of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed a hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many choices in the nine minutes of a few thousand people in the one hour of an hour ?
how good , think about it , are you going to solve your decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the most profound <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , please raise , and i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is , are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a senior student at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> convenience ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store , the <unk> .
this is a business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of fruits -- and that was a time when we had actually gotten to <unk> .
i loved it to this business , but at a time i asked myself , well , how come you know ?
here &apos;s the olive gait .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil , including those who were embedded in these boxes that came from a thousand years of old <unk> .
so i decided to visit a day day to visit the leader , and i asked the director , &quot; it &apos;s really going to work this model that you really offer all of these capabilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of the tourists that every day came and would have had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gait .
they had different kinds of <unk> .
we have a little <unk> right on the entrance to the <unk> .
we &apos;ve put six different flavors of interdependence , or <unk> , and we put two kinds of devices , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i would like to be more people and try and try and try ?
there are more people left when they were 24 , about 60 percent than if it were six , about 40 percent .
and then we saw in what people were more likely to buy a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
the people who were standing when they were 24 , they only bought three percent of the <unk> .
and the people who were standing when they were six , well , now we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do a math , you buy the people six times more of a glass of <unk> who you had to have six to a choice , when you had 24 / choices .
now , don &apos;t get to buy a glass of <unk> , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that the <unk> will affect us as well as it &apos;s affecting us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s about our own best interests .
so the issue of the day : saving financial .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were able to make decisions to retirement , almost a million americans of about <unk> plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> that were a <unk> possible , the <unk> plan that affect the probability of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found that it was indeed a correlation .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered the people anything between two to the <unk> of different fund .
and what we found was that the more <unk> were offered that the more procedures were offered that , indeed , <unk> .
if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered the two fund , had a <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that <unk> almost 60 fund , the <unk> was now on the <unk> .
now , it turns out that if you &apos;re in charge of yourself , if more choices are , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the more rather more often , that the more possibilities they were available , the more likely they would have been taking charge and <unk> fund .
the more possibilities they were available , the more they would have to put their money in pure <unk> .
no one of these extreme decisions , is to make sure that someone would recommend people to do care of people , if you &apos;re important to the future financial .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve observed the evidence that we &apos;ve seen negative consequences that will provide the offer of more and more choices .
they can make the decision -- push it , even if it &apos;s against their own best interests .
they make more likely decisions -- worse and worse health decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide to be more interested in things that you &apos;re going to be less happy , even if you make an objective better .
the main reason for this is that maybe we &apos;re enjoying this enormous set of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we really couldn &apos;t make the compare and the limiting , and then actually something that really could choose to be the amazing offer .
so what i &apos;m going to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested in different ways and tested in different <unk> -- they can use it in their business .
first , just .
you &apos;ve heard it before before , but it was never true as it today , that less is .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; push . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose <unk> .
but in fact , we &apos;re going to see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to focus on , and the <unk> <unk> will be going , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s brought to cost , and it &apos;s brought to cost , and there &apos;s a <unk> improvement .
as a cross-country skier and <unk> <unk> species to <unk> species from 26 to 15 , they had a increase in sales to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation , her 10 , <unk> , they were <unk> to <unk> , they were the returns to cover 87 percent of the <unk> -- a result of the two , the increase sales and reducing costs .
you know , the average <unk> today , you &apos;re supplying 45,000 products .
a typical person &apos;s offering 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , the world &apos;s largest <unk> supermarket in the world is <unk> , and they &apos;re just giving them a mere amount of tomato sauce .
now in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the best examples that recently came to the market is to be the best examples of the choices , something that david <unk> has very strong <unk> , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered to harvard .
every single harvard users , it &apos;s automatically <unk> at a <unk> portion .
those who are really going to make a choice , they &apos;re offered to 20 fund , not 300 or more .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to just go .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if you can &apos;t <unk> your employees , you can &apos;t do it either . &quot;
well before we &apos;ve started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said he said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience , to offer a <unk> , on the most beautiful road to the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read them .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read you , and then please give you a <unk> , if you &apos;re willing to take it to be gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to take it to take it to take it to take it .
are that all of this ?
well , let me show you a little more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i might have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s looking at the first time you have more information , when the second time you had to do it , but i would dare to guess that it was real true .
because the pictures had really <unk> for them .
what i &apos;m going to do is to bring me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding that people to understand the difference between the individual possibilities , and that have to be associated with the consequences and have to feel that this consequences and specific way .
why do people use average 15 to 30 percent more if they use a <unk> or a <unk> , as if brown ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel that we &apos;re really going to feel like .
and it turns out , if you make it , it feels a very good tool , so you can get people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people at <unk> -- who &apos;s worth working for <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they &apos;ve signed their participation for their <unk> .
and during that meeting , we &apos;ve been as a little bit like that , just as they were , just like we added a little more .
the little thing we &apos;ve got to do was that we were asked to have asked to think that we would just have asked to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in which we did this easy thing , there was an increase in participation in the number of people who were willing to save , or one increase in the amount of <unk> , they were willing to pay for the <unk> .
the third technology : <unk> .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
so here &apos;s a study that we did in a <unk> .
it turns out it &apos;s going to be in the <unk> <unk> up and down in the northeast , a large number of <unk> different kinds of magazines and highly <unk> .
but do you know what ?
if i show you 600 pounds , and they &apos;re going to show 400 magazines , and they &apos;re going to show 400 magazines , and they &apos;re going to do 400 magazines , and they &apos;re going to think that i have given more choices and a better <unk> , when i gave them the 400 <unk> , if i had 600 to them .
because the categories of the categories , i can think of them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other meaning is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the one is <unk> <unk> and the ad on the piece is , you &apos;re clapping in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and the ones on the right side is , you &apos;re going to clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out you &apos;re right .
the one on the left side is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories must say something that is the choice of making .
and this problem you see a lot when you look at the long lists of all of these <unk> .
who are you really talking about it ?
my fourth technology : the notion of complexity .
it turns out that in fact , we can only deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german photographer who offers them the opportunity to <unk> their car completely .
they have to make a different decision to design their car .
now , now , these decisions in the number of choices that they offer a choice .
<unk> , <unk> of cars -- i have 56 possibilities .
engines , new ways -- four ways .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of the making decisions .
half of the customer is going to be about the many possibilities , 56 <unk> to the low possibilities , four in the other .
the other half of the customers are going to the low possibilities , four blocks , to <unk> <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at me ?
how are you .
if you &apos;re constantly using the <unk> of the decision , that means that you will be overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you find is that people who go from the many of the very low <unk> and still choose to vote .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choices to the many , then remain it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is to change the sequence in which this information is being addressed .
if i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m .
even though the gears is to pick up , and i don &apos;t say anything about my preferences in the interiors , it &apos;s always going to be to chose to pick me .
it enables me to be very excited about the big product i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate me to be interested in it .
let me wrap up .
i told you about four techniques , which is the problem of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- they &apos;re going to be real ; <unk> -- do it -- we &apos;ve got better with more categories , less ways , to cope with complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibility -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re directing at a selection .
and the more we pick up , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> , i look at the youtube . i &apos;m looking at the <unk> .
right .
today , we want to talk about how video <unk> are going to be , and then , therefore , is important .
we all want to be stars -- <unk> , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely .
but <unk> have enabled us that we all have all of our creative activities are famous to be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be about the internet to the next saturday saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours to put up a little uploaded .
again , a tiny percentage ever looked at it and will look at thousands of times and the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> , this video that he photographed in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like when the video was popular as the video first summer was popular .
in fact , no mere viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that , if you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually flown in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video eventually made the video .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , are going to make us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> . you didn &apos;t think we would lead this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca <unk> &apos;s a popular video of the year .
it was viewed almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
as &quot; double raindrop , &quot; it seems to be made of nowhere .
what &apos;s going to happen to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you know , these other peaks are also <unk> tips .
but what about this day , this particular one of friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> , it started writing a lot of blogs .
michael j. nelson was first of the most , the most of the <unk> , and was a joke with twitter .
and what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> has a point of view , with a big audience and <unk> the process .
and then these community formed from people who shared this great <unk> , and started playing with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; in youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a parody for every week of the day .
unlike the 20th entertainment entertainment , the community of the community , is going to be a part of this phenomenon -- either by making it or something new .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it for crazy , you &apos;d better know that there was a <unk> <unk> , which was four million times .
even cats , even look at this video .
cats look at cats , who look at this video .
and important , the creativity that are in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there was it .
somebody made an <unk> version of it .
and then it became international .
all of the <unk> came from the ground , which made it from a stupid joke , something that we all participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure from something we do .
who would have been able to do anything ?
who would have predicted the &quot; double raindrop &quot; or rebecca black or <unk> <unk> .
what <unk> did you write about , where that &apos;s kind of <unk> ?
in a world where each one minute two days of video , can only be uploaded to the very unique and unexpected <unk> like the video / video .
i admit i wasn &apos;t really interested in a friend , i should say to myself this great video , and the guy who &apos;s in new york against a parking ticket for civic slums .
i got a ticket because i was not on the <unk> , but often there &apos;s a disability that i have a not order to drive a <unk> on the <unk> .
and this is completely surprising and humorous , casey <unk> was an idea and his argument would be looking at five million times .
this approach is all of the new things we do .
and that &apos;s all going to give us a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to the audience and certainly the audience .
as i said , one of the most currently stars -- justin <unk> -- did his beginning to youtube .
no one has to give your ideas to green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as <unk> of our culture culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not making barely the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how do i talk about three generations , and how the amazing strength of these interactions , and in the house of a little sister , and the <unk> of the <unk> , a little girl , and she was going to be a handle that was <unk> in life that little girl in the life of this little girl , and never disappeared , and this little girl &apos;s now live in san francisco , and now she &apos;s talking about them today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be done .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning his <unk> .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom of its home .
hold it in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he must say that his life was a single load .
the words , so long of his friends , <unk> , now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never have to forget my life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was going to be , it was a story that was going to be made us , we &apos;re going to go through .
the next <unk> shows like a boat in the early <unk> silent on lake .
my mom may , my mom may , when her father died -- i was already in a <unk> marriage , with two little girls .
for you , they had a job : the <unk> of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely clear that she could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat , and the lake , as a <unk> .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear was <unk> , rape and death .
as most of the adult put on the boat , my mom had a little baby <unk> .
and i just had a <unk> , and i would have to drink my sister and then my grandmother to drink it .
my first memories are from this boat -- this is the continuous <unk> of the motor , the clapping of a wave on the front , the width and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember i remember the pirate prosthesis that was many times , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat , or at the <unk> of the motor , the <unk> of the motor , the six hours of no .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> coast off the <unk> coast , and the young man , the lights of the <unk> coast , and the young man , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> to give me one of the men in the platform .
no apple ever tasted it .
after three months , we ended up in melbourne in the refugee camp .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations , which together together , create a new life .
we let us down in <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> of the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , the existence of me was not unknown , there was no <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> were developed among people who had a thing in common : they started new .
my mom was working on farms , then on a line of <unk> , six days , <unk> .
and it sort of delivered the time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
and every dollar being had been given to english and mathematics , whatever we have to do for this , and most of the time , the new stuff that came from the second hand .
two few <unk> for the school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because they had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here , and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; ugh , go home . &quot;
so then , where ?
something more profound to me .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a <unk> voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the road . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mom was exhausted every night , but we told each other of our day and hear the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mom suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> came to me so that i could <unk> it .
she opened a <unk> , then she made a <unk> and a half .
and the women came with their stories about men that don &apos;t <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> kids , trapped between two worlds .
loans and donors were looking for .
centers became established .
i was living in <unk> .
one was i was talking to the classic american student , who was <unk> <unk> .
in the other , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence wore , the <unk> and the <unk> .
but so many of the got help .
and because of that aid , i became <unk> in my last year as a boy <unk> of the year .
and i was <unk> to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was now <unk> to <unk> and social , who had never heard of places that had never heard and in houses whose existence could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to a routine -- a grandmother , a mom and two daughters that would be <unk> for every day of the <unk> , like the last 20 years , by watching each other the stories and the other day , we were still in the same bed .
i told my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she remembered me that i was now as old as we went back the boat .
no , no one has been a chance .
&quot; do it just &quot; said , &quot; and not , what you don &apos;t . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should say .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated from my graduate , i realized that i couldn &apos;t come to my own career in law .
there was another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the picture -- not just okay , but something you must be grateful for , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can lead so easily to collapse in the <unk> , so easily mean , that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve been enough from my <unk> to know that , yeah , the world , but not as you do it .
the opportunity that would not have been to be allowed , were explicitly <unk> .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; not a <unk> challenge .
we had no cents on a year .
and at the end of one day , i cooking a huge array of soup we shared .
we worked until late night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant ones , and we did the breakthrough .
i made the decision to draw in the united states .
just after a trip there .
my gut feeling .
three months later , i was moved and went to the adventure .
before i go to the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time in the <unk> , and the local <unk> the most important person .
and they had not changed the life for centuries .
her father died after her birth .
her mother moved to it alone .
and by 17 , she became the second woman to <unk> her mother .
without support your husband &apos;s support for a <unk> , by having him brought it in front of court and <unk> in her own case , and a bigger <unk> than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; to be <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and she looked at the other side .
i knew she came to say goodbye .
my mom called me a few minutes ago .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her .
we told her stories and <unk> , that we were still in .
and at midnight , the monk came up and said , he must end the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
and she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s been since today , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t have released . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men that might have come in our lives , we would have come to the <unk> .
defeat was just too easy .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
who would ever have a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , ease , <unk> .
can i give you a front of your life , the courageous of any wave , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the motor , the <unk> , the total horizon , that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and you could certainly <unk> it , i would do it .
and also , <unk> &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or a fifth .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it possible at all ?
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t pick with your camera .
and yet , my interest began photography when i got my first digital digital digital , age 15 years old .
i put it with my former <unk> for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because the way that the camera was doing was in planning .
and if you take a picture of a camera with a camera , end the process , if you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about the photography , to be more about the right place to right place .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts with the process when the trigger gets kept .
and photographs like this : a site site , along a much more <unk> road .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and <unk> , however , a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> , but all of the shared goal of creating a realistic level .
if i &apos;m a reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , you don &apos;t really mean , you can actually catch , but i want to make it look like this , as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photos , where you have to think a brief , to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about trying to capture an idea when a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details , or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what makes the illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
and then the final thing is , how do we interpret the world and how it can be made on a two-dimensional space .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think about realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly <unk> , physical objects that we &apos;ve all identify with , in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can create something that looks like that , and that &apos;s what it might be like that , and that &apos;s what it might be like .
but we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re <unk> our brains , because our brains don &apos;t really simply simply make sense of it .
and i see the same process in combining images .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think , because otherwise you &apos;re just going to look wrong .
so i would say there &apos;s three simple rules to obey , to get a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special pictures .
so , you know , it &apos;s just a bit different like this .
so the first rule is that , putting pictures of the same perspective .
secondly , they have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures are meeting these two metabolic requirements -- from the same height shot and the same <unk> .
and third is about to make it impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end , by connecting them into it .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how did this photograph actually be made .
so by looking at color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the individual images , photographic color and disorders , we &apos;re going to <unk> the boundaries between the different images , and let them look like a single picture , although there &apos;s basically a single photograph of the levels of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape , and that &apos;s been manipulated in the bottom part .
but this image is completely composed , from the photos of different locations .
i personally personally doubt that it &apos;s easier to create a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into a compromise , with the ideas in your head .
but it takes a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> .
the shore comes from a different place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yeah , i even put the house up on the island of red to make it look remotely .
to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s seen from me to planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of a time .
and if you do good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it can be pretty realistic .
so they &apos;re all the tools there , and the only thing that we can &apos;t have limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i would love to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> are failing .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced to the <unk> was a <unk> .
and it &apos;s not very scientific , and it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how about it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- most of the electronic <unk> <unk> : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite story . a very simple thing .
she has a button , it &apos;s got out of it .
and every morning i &apos;m going to go .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job at <unk> pounds .
it just works , every time i get to the scale , then you send my data to google health .
and there it also is <unk> by my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and not only the moment i need to do support support or something , but also with a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i &apos;m going to go back to my <unk> and people talk about me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch , just rather than just a <unk> lettuce , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used to be obesity , or it could be the smoking <unk> .
but it could also be used to get people from their chair and get them to play together in any ways to control their health .
next week , this is coming up to the market .
it will give you this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to do on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to share from home to their blood pressure , to measure it to your doctor and to share it with other , for something more than 100 dollars .
and so , you get the control over the patient , and you can &apos;t just get the control over , you can just help the challenges of taking the <unk> on your own , but can help us help health care of challenges that are in front of us , and the <unk> of health , <unk> demand , and so on .
they &apos;re using the methods that are easy to use , and they start to hug with this to hug patients .
and they can do this by these kinds of practices , but also through that .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is , i want to share with you through a short video .
we &apos;ve all got our cars in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the machines are all the machines are around .
we know one more , where all of the gas stations .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where the next hadron collider is to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next <unk> of the next <unk> <unk> was to find .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we built a website and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with you where he &apos;s when he &apos;s on , &quot; because it &apos;s as <unk> closed , of course .
and 10,000 <unk> were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find applications for this .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> .
we developed an app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone &apos;s lying down , you can use your iphone , and in the next weeks , your <unk> , can save the next <unk> , saving lives .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to be just as a <unk> , as the product is called , but also , as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other people universities , to help us , like <unk> , to crowdsource these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody goes down , it &apos;s your own blood supply , or someone else , you can find a <unk> like this .
the other thing we want to ask for is that companies all over the world are helping us to help the <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in his place .
please help us and try and take it to do something like not just improving the health , but to take your hand .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i &apos;m working in the <unk> .
and my little bit of <unk> is we &apos;re forcing ourselves to make us to make the environment by doing ...
... it &apos;s <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh , a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s a little bit .
now , we can just skip -- i &apos;m going to just roll the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i &apos;ve launched a program to get a year of <unk> and design to get a year from a year and work in an environment that really , you know , we &apos;ve let them work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like <unk> for <unk> .
we pick up a few of the fellows and we &apos;re working with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into <unk> .
and there &apos;s something that they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible with technology .
so they meet al .
al &apos;s a <unk> in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is someone who is looking for him , when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when he &apos;s a meter of snow .
how did he come to look for this particular way of looking for help ?
we had a team from fellows in boston to the code for america .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of <unk> in the last february .
and they found that the city never would have these fire <unk> out of <unk> .
but one particular fellow called erik <unk> , who had another little bit , and that was the residents that were free to <unk> the <unk> , right before these parts .
so he did what every good gave of the engineers , he was writing an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app called where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you put it free to it , if it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a very humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the <unk> apps that we wrote in the last year .
but she does something that no other <unk> does .
it &apos;s expanding <unk> .
so , there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , who saw that app could use this app , not for snow , but for the citizens of civic <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to test them .
and then , seattle , to use the app to use the app to try to clean the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago is just introduced to people who <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> .
we know now nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s made very <unk> , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s not normally going to be .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that was working on a project last year , for three people and a half months .
it was about a method of the parents to find out what the right public schools are for their children .
and then later , we told that if it took over the normal channels that would have taken over two years , and it paid over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even anything .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california , the <unk> has paid two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of governance .
so an app that was written in a few days , and then spreading turns out of <unk> , it &apos;s kind of a shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better , no more like a private company , how many people think that they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access to open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that you represents a new generation that represents the problem of the government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at designing digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need to need things to do things in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; and there are hundreds of people around the country that are getting up and <unk> , everyday communities every day .
they don &apos;t have given the government .
they &apos;re sick with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix it .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all of your feelings about politics and the line in the <unk> and all the other things that we really upset with , is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do in common , we can &apos;t do that alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you to get <unk> because things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally gets their force out of us -- <unk> yourself : &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought that the government is mostly going to be in office people .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in the local communities , to go <unk> .
this is the call for service and information .
there &apos;s you &apos;re going to come out when you &apos;re <unk> in your city .
if you ever have to work in your <unk> call center , like our fellow scott <unk> &apos;s part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all doing this -- you &apos;ll see that the people who are government because of many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
so scott &apos;s all this <unk> .
he type <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house and you &apos;re open and see it very loud music and see if it &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . and then , with scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
in boston , not just call a call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write that app .
this is the work of intelligent people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is a actual report -- came in , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away from it ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott <unk> : human <unk>
but on the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s all in public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it looked a neighbor .
and the next post we got , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
and then the <unk> <unk> on the page . went home .
good night , cute <unk> . &quot;
just pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government of the <unk> is .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a <unk> definition of platform .
i &apos;m more likely to be a platform for people , to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped citizen support another citizen , but the government was playing a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you would have to connect them with the state of <unk> if that needs had been , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
if a neighbor of the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contributions to the system is to vote .
how many times we use a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we lean back and expect the government to reflect and the needs of our needs , and then it hasn &apos;t changed much ?
that &apos;s because the government like a higher ocean is and politics are the supreme <unk> .
and what underneath is , what is underneath is what we called in charge .
and we use this word with these kinds of contempt .
but it &apos;s these contempt that we have , and we &apos;re paying for the ones that we have , and we &apos;re paying for the fact that is working against us , something else , and then we &apos;re <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make it look like its bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is going to happen .
we need to get into the engine of the governance .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which has written a response to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not political , that &apos;s active .
now , for those of us who have the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that what we need to do is to improve the institution , which is to be the name of us all ?
and it &apos;s absolutely vital , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government fundamentally fundamental in a way that actually can actually be <unk> by the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up , and the <unk> , and the idea that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build only the right systems .
now the average age of the fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up to see your voice as a no-brainer .
they &apos;re not fighting the fight , which we all fight , is to talk about who speak , they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can think your mind , every single canal , and you do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the governance , it &apos;s not so much about being the voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of the government .
and these apps , let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and sure , we would have been able to have this <unk> all the time , and lots of people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government who receive taxes and receive the performance .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government to improve the government .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to you is , if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we will just be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
so my role of the new technology that is going to be the <unk> are , i would tell you what i &apos;m going to do , and i thought , and i &apos;m thinking about what i &apos;m going to do and see what &apos;s really going on here , with these incredible <unk> , and so quickly , we can &apos;t keep up with this incredible thing .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a little bit of a little bit of showing you a little bit of a little bit .
... could you just show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;m going to have selected from my folder .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details of the slide , but rather around the general form .
this slide is to show a analysis of the performance of <unk> <unk> , compared to the performance of a <unk> area .
and what &apos;s interesting here is , as many other people we find in our field , a kind of just <unk> curve .
in other words , each step here is a power in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty that we have to use this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could give the light back to you again .
something that happens to a little bit , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now , why do we draw on the <unk> of <unk> curves ?
the reason for this is , if i &apos;m going to draw it on a regular curve , and this is a kind of <unk> increase , and this is an arbitrary component of technology that i want to solve with a graph , the graph is silly .
and then you see this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , it would be a scale scale , <unk> , shape of a flat line .
but if something like this , it changes the most dramatic changes .
so if the <unk> are so swift as the <unk> of progress , we could put back into a taxi and in 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that quickly .
that was never before history in history , these kinds of <unk> growth , which is exponentially increase in the order of the order of the order .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , you don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever and forever is progressing as fast as it is .
there are two ways .
either it will be an classic <unk> like here , to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is it about .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is going to happen .
so , that &apos;s really , that means we &apos;re in a middle of the middle of a transition here .
we &apos;re on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is like this new world ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 and people were often talking about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now , we have a conference here , where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still 2000 .
and we don &apos;t go and do that .
so in other words , the future is expanding for the future of a year , since i &apos;m in this world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize that anything is going on .
the transition is going . we can feel it all .
and we know that there &apos;s simply no way to look at the future , because it &apos;s all so different , because it &apos;s so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now is simply making no sense .
so i want to talk about what that could be , this transition in which we are right now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really nothing has nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i really think about this , we need to go back and look at the point of a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of the earth .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is a half billion years , and the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with a lot of these <unk> chemicals .
so , if you look at the way these chemicals , we have a pretty good picture about how you &apos;re doing it .
i also think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything i started , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit more subtle story that is that there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> <unk> that are different kinds of <unk> for chemicals .
some of these <unk> are created by the kind of chemicals that they allow them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow them .
all of these were the ones , it was <unk> .
these little <unk> were in the senses that were <unk> <unk> .
but , these <unk> are not about living in the way , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time it divided , it &apos;s spread out of the <unk> chemicals .
so every single time was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which one for the growth of <unk> composition had faster than others and integrated and more chemicals from the outside and divided faster .
so that &apos;s what they tend to survive longer , and they adapted to <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is it , if that <unk> &apos;s trick for abstraction .
in any way we don &apos;t fully understand , this <unk> , is the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe for the cell as information , and in a certain chemical shape that we call dna .
in this case , in this <unk> , evolutionary species found a way that allowed them to <unk> what they were doing , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing about that is that this kind of information might have been over the time of 2.5 billion years that they were born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from the exactly same code and the same one .
and every thing uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re far , that we can write only for the <unk> , even in this code .
and i &apos;ve got a hundred yards of a white <unk> that i try to keep in airports from <unk> to the airports .
so it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is , &quot; the code is of normal letters that we use to compute -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it &apos;s been <unk> 10 ^ 22 .
so if you want to give someone a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a <unk> , i would have been writing on a virus on a virus and open it up .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna system of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened to another , very interesting step where things were completely different , and that &apos;s what these cells were going to grow up to communicate and information , so that communities were born by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you already knew that , but bacteria actually can exchange their dna .
and that &apos;s why for example , for example , is expanding for antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how they run from penicillin from penicillin , and they have this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are going to be resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication was allowed for the reasons of communities that were in the same boat , they were <unk> .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and they were together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more and more over and from evolution .
so the <unk> is now there , where these communities are so close to the recipe for the whole community , they decided to write a recipe for the entire community .
and the next thing was about another billion years .
at that moment , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which is together as a single organism .
in fact , we are also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not being challenged by themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the plane that would have done on evolution , no longer was the single cell , but the whole <unk> that we call .
the next step is now within these communities .
the <unk> started to make information .
and they developed special structures that nothing else made of being able to process information inside the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that these <unk> have built .
they started to train specialists within the community , specifically structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning happened now within the time of a single organism , rather than that evolutionary period .
so one organism could learn to eat a particular fruit , because they made bad and it sick , the last time he liked it .
now this could now happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas the hundreds of thousands of years have been needed because this information was needed by the individuals who died because of these fruit , because these <unk> don &apos;t exist .
so the nervous system has the <unk> using this particular <unk> system , because evolution could now take place within a individual .
it could take place within a time of a physical place .
what happened after that , the individual organisms have to found a way to communicate with each other .
for example , the <unk> <unk> us known version of this <unk> is human language .
but it &apos;s a rather amazing invention to think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically taking notes from me , in the hope of a very <unk> idea in your head that has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , and they transform it in sounds around , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this allows us to work back as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we know , we &apos;ve started to put them up .
we cut through the same stages , which <unk> have gone through -- the abstraction of our methods , how we present data .
so the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , computer , <unk> , and so on , all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to be able to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much greater , and capable of developing more faster than we were .
so nowadays , evolution &apos;s got to be done by the <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen <unk> little <unk> , where he &apos;s a little bit of evolution in the <unk> , <unk> , right front of your eyes .
so now we have <unk> <unk> .
the first steps of the story i &apos;ve told you about , <unk> a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be just a few decades .
the process is feeding itself , and so , so , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- when something is <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
i live professionally professionally , and i know that i know that the mechanism i could use to build computers , not use , without the recent times of computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what any individual <unk> in the <unk> do .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designer of thinking of thinking is doing , is we think about this machine , <unk> this machine , and the machine , that makes our ability to go far beyond , better and faster than we could possibly possibly .
and it &apos;s partly using methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way , which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been doing in recently , is the evolution of evolution .
we put a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that developed from random weather .
we say , &quot; computers , please , please , a hundred million random sequences of the instructions .
now please , all of these random chosen people , they &apos;re going to come from , lead all the programs , and vote for the end of the things that my own policies are . &quot;
so in other words , i guess what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to split numbers , that would be a simple example that i used for .
so , think of the programs that are most likely to rank numbers .
of course , the chance of any random party is very small that they &apos;re not going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , so probably the instructions will actually make this .
but one of those may be very lucky to have two numbers into the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the number 10 percent of the sequences that have my own <unk> .
and you go down , <unk> the rest .
now , <unk> all the <unk> have to put the numbers in the best .
and this is a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchanges of their <unk> , and the children are <unk> the characteristics of the <unk> of two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that were made by combinations of programs that came from a little bit closer to the policies than others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them .
maybe i have some mutations .
and try this whole generation again with another generation .
all of these generations are just going to have few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution of millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or more complex cases , some hours .
and finally , i get to get the programs that are <unk> .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever write from hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s regional and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job because you get a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because your life depended on whether they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , <unk> a map and says , &quot; look , look . look at this .
there &apos;s it &apos;s like , &quot; this plane is made of <unk> <unk> , which is together working on your flight to make your flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t you make it more ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t perfect when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start with computers , for a process that is different from the classical engineering .
he allows us to make things a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to make .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so <unk> <unk> gives us the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer a lot more quickly , so that we can actually do these processes faster .
so it &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s getting faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies depend on themselves today .
we go down .
we &apos;re at a point where there &apos;s been in the back of the time , when they were evolving to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite make any of what we do , what we &apos;re doing here is , are .
we are in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think that &apos;s coming to us .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> about to say that we are the end of evolution .
and i think we all have here , part of the creation of what is going to happen next .
now , lunch is before and i &apos;m going to think i &apos;m going to go back before i &apos;m going to go .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert , with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about nothing has changed anything since the ancient indian <unk> &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we do it with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> thirst took , he took a bow , pulled up the ground and water .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic is replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a little bit of fear technology .
i &apos;m afraid that i could lose the ability to lose the <unk> , and without tweet about my friends .
i found that technology should make a magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
and this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became an <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> and <unk> in my mind .
i was like to come up with us our <unk> clocks and cameras from them to dream .
they were inspired by the way that they were inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make a magic to kill rather than kill .
so , at age 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling to connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking images and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
that storytelling has been more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive <unk> app .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box is -- &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
and over a letter , a letter came down for me -- and the ipad knows through gps , where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean a magician and dragon dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies are very exciting in a glass , i found all over .
so you have to take the ipad off and the fireflies <unk> .
and the light bulb is the way that the rest of the book .
another idea that i &apos;m being as a child is that a whole galaxy can be placed in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s a book here , every book and every world that i prefer to put on here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always seen cards , but these cards were static .
this map is expanding and it &apos;s just to orientation and it &apos;s for a orientation to orientation .
she also shows in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to go here .
and it &apos;s important for me to do something that is <unk> , but also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of the <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside of india &apos;s know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were in <unk> in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history for children .
a story that &apos;s going to go with new issues like the <unk> .
for the subject , a big problem for the last 10 years , kids in their dorm seats are sitting in their dorm rooms , they don &apos;t go out of their own computers .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with their technology .
in a way of the book , you will find a search for a search , you have to go out and collect the ipads images of natural objects .
as a kid , i had collections of <unk> stones , rocks and <unk> .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> , <unk> . you have to go out to make a photograph of a flower and to tag on a chapter .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of <unk> and tag .
so , actually , you create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to plan a interaction with the video of the ipads and using <unk> architecture , a animation of <unk> that appear on a plant of the house .
there &apos;s a place with the leaves with the leaves with the leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , you &apos;re going to read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural world of technology can come and can come back and technology and technology .
we &apos;re using energy in the sun .
we bring our kids to our children and closer to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood , through the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really a remarkable honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there are much consensus .
here at ted , to see and hear , how stimulating this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of force .
in the short time here , i was a clear : ted has an identity .
you can say things that are impact on the world .
and sometimes , when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise otherwise .
i say that , because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a profession is what they have , but the words of a dedicated teacher are special meaningful .
as a physician , you can do good . and as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have learned this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i was being raised in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had a effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was a daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as slaves .
it was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was a lot , but she was also <unk> .
if i met her as a young boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
and she pushed me so that i could barely breathe , and then let me go .
and one of two later , when i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , feel you still feel my hug ? &quot;
and when i said no , i &apos;m going to give me back . if i said , &quot; i said , &quot; let me go through .
and she was something that made you always wanted to be close to her .
the only problem that was that they had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins fell around everywhere .
i remember i got to remember eight or nine , i &apos;ve been standing up and went into the living room . all my cousins were around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the concert and he was staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood over and she came over and she took me over and i said , &quot; come on , come on , <unk> . you and i , you know , you need to talk . &quot;
i remember that as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit , but you have to promise you don &apos;t get it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m told , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
and she sat me up and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; as the first thing i &apos;m told you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s my baby and you have to get you to take care of them . &quot;
i paraphrase my mom , so i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; as next to me , you know , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; and if it &apos;s hard to get to do right .
i thought , &quot; well , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is &quot; that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother that &apos;s older age , and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , one day , my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with grabbed my sister and went to the forest .
we just <unk> around the way .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister and she took it , and then she offered me one of me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . it just wants to do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do you do . now we do this , you &apos;re doing anything that we do .
i had what , your sister had what , go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do it . do it only . just do it . &quot;
my brother shut me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , what &apos;s going to do ?
and then he looked at me and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do it crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother all told everybody &apos;s grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you a little bit .
i should probably not do that .
this is perhaps going to be public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i <unk> that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i believe it &apos;s <unk> . i &apos;m saying that because identity means .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us , which they don &apos;t know .
we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course my grandmother would say all of your grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in prison during the prison riots .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these are the topics we have to care about .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
in &apos; 51 people were 300,000 people in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> in the world .
seven million people are on <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
i think the world is deeply changing .
in social respect and the black , there are dominated and hopelessness , because of that change .
one of three male black among the 18 and 30 is in prison , prison , on <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere -- from los angeles , in the country -- from los angeles to washington communities , in some <unk> of black young men either live in prison , prison , on <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not only being built by asking , the <unk> , and it &apos;s also <unk> by poverty .
we have a <unk> that you &apos;re treated much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , it &apos;s also influenced by the outcome .
and yet , we seem to be very pleased with it .
a policy from fear and anger , we &apos;ve convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some <unk> things .
my home state , <unk> , permanent <unk> , when they &apos;re <unk> .
here , in alabama , there &apos;s a 34 percent of the male black population , would be lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the <unk> of the civic <unk> will be as high as before the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the most peaceful children of death in prison .
there are children in this country for children who are <unk> without <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of progress .
the only country in the world .
i &apos;m <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think , because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is , has a human being made for a man to die for a <unk> ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about thinking about how we see our identity .
the other way is not , does anyone deserves to make a crime , but it deserves to kill it , to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
in the nine people we were executed , we have been executed , who we have to be innocent , who was released from death row from death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of the nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let someone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , the lift , one more obvious .
but somehow , we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to <unk> it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking about these questions .
i talk about race and the question whether we have right to kill it .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking about my students , african-american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time , at the end of the permian , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the guy in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people were afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking about the people , you say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you &apos;re talking about , for the first time in history of our nation with terrorism , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and defeating apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our issues .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly progressing together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to get a hard time to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not too overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in that country .
i &apos;ve given some speeches in germany , and i &apos;ve given the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply silly to hear you talk to it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , they can never give them more . &quot;
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever have to do this <unk> killing of people .
it would be <unk> , you know , and <unk> people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like to live in a world where german german people were <unk> especially when there were many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we are going to be a <unk> risk of knowing that if you &apos;re black , you get a <unk> , if you &apos;re black , and the victim knows , in the same states , in the same states , in its own world , <unk> people .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these tough topics , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but then finally , these realities are <unk> , <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , to be able to make a complex world .
for me , for me , is going to work and think about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> that are never going to be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own life .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we appreciate it .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe that is not just being open to all the <unk> and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , who &apos;s great <unk> politicians , once once said .
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe , we wanted to be able to do everything , but what we needed most of the most , hope , an intellectual orientation , the willingness to be able to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
and this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that the <unk> have to be involved in this .
there &apos;s no way to technology and design that allowed us to be fully and <unk> , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges are much more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch it .
as a young lawyer , i gave the great privilege to meet a pink parks .
and over time , after <unk> , they were going back to <unk> , where they had two of their oldest friends of <unk> -- an unbelievable <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were met and they were just going to be .
and then , <unk> , and then , i was going to talk about , and i said , &quot; <unk> , woman park coming into the city . we want to have a conversation .
do you want to listen to you and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just just listened to .
it was always so inspiring , so evocative .
and one day i sat there and i was sitting there to a few hours , and after a few hours , sat down to me to tell us , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the &quot; <unk> &quot; for the same is right .
what are you going to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to be in injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight the positions and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to lower the number of death death .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;ll make it very , very tired . &quot;
then , she <unk> himself , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we have to ask ourselves <unk> , these issues , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our own humanity .
i learned a very simple things in my work .
i learned a few simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a burglar .
even who kills somebody &apos;s not just a murderer .
and because that &apos;s because there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and with certainty , in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think it .
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatically , so beautiful and inspiring , and so forth , we don &apos;t use the end of our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re going to do , not in our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they &apos;re treated their rich and the <unk> , but it &apos;s like to deal with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we really start to grasp things that make us a real amazing thing that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are acting in our thinking , in very important ways .
i &apos;m going to <unk> these kids who were convicted on a very rough punishment .
i go into the wheelhouse and visit a client that may be 13 or 14 years old , and being asked to be an adult before the courts .
then i wonder , how could that happen ?
how can a judge make someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge is looking at him as adults , but i see a child .
and one night i stayed too long on and thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , it must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judges has <unk> .
you should also be able to do that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think that i could think about it , i started to work on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor boy at the rest .
and i started to this . the headline said , &quot; to , my poor , <unk> black , <unk> , as a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and the police and the police and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , that there &apos;s nothing more <unk> than that , that there &apos;s nothing in error .
the next morning i woke up and i couldn &apos;t know if i was going to get this crazy thing , or actually wrote it .
and i was not just written him , and i was sent him to my horror .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but then finally , i decided , my god , i must have to go into the court and this crazy case .
i got to be overwhelmed in the car , and i was overwhelmed with this .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard to do .
and finally , i went from my car and went up to the court .
when i was going to the staircase , there was an elderly , black man , who was wishing in court .
and when he saw me , he came up to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
and he did whisper in my ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was a force .
it touched something deeply , and identity , the ability to contribute to each other , to contribute to a community , to a point of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you asked this crazy ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started talking about .
and more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things i had written .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin skin , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw the janitors in my <unk> and go down .
he &apos;s always seen through the window and i could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and down .
after all , this elderly black man had a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and he was going to put behind me , almost to the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judges took a break .
during the break , a <unk> came in , which was the janitors who was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
the old black man stood up . he saw me , and he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say this young man , lose the goal of not the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you understood that the moral pendulum in the universe is far more <unk> , but that it &apos;s the justice .
we &apos;re not fully developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our all of our survival is to survive every single connected .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and creation , entertainment and creativity , with humanity , mercy and justice .
and most of all , i want to show you that this is as just say , just lose the goal . don &apos;t you go .
you have this audience , this community , that community has a obvious wish to help and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are all over opportunity .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> , in this spring , where it &apos;s about to actually do a company , something of the most <unk> <unk> that will go into the politics of that , in the politics of that .
here , in california , for example , you will be a billion dollars for death of a billion dollars for death of a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> don &apos;t end with a <unk> .
56 percent never come in front of court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this is a <unk> , suggesting that money into more <unk> and safety .
i think there are ways .
over the last three decades , the <unk> in america is immense .
this is a fact that &apos;s going to be a relationship with elevated performance .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of <unk> didn &apos;t change very .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really find the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic rates are going to be a high pay at prison .
we &apos;ve got our <unk> from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have the <unk> , the <unk> people who are going to put out of bars for a <unk> , for the theft of good <unk> good , rather than you force them to give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who become a <unk> victim , not less .
and i think our current doesn &apos;t help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have a string valve here .
they are a inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden &apos;s <unk> is an increased <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : famine in somalia , two : the o.c. spray of the police .
four : <unk> <unk> . they &apos;re dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . they were seven : 65 dead .
<unk> : meet 9 .
different speakers : <unk> . mass of mass destruction .
recession . a standstill . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media is prefer to show the negative subjects , because our minds are getting attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second day , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever digest .
and because of nothing more important than our survival , the first stop stop for all the information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> system , our <unk> .
it and <unk> the whole information on the quest for any <unk> of the risk of our surroundings .
so if we see the news , we prefer to think about negative news .
and the old adage &quot; if it fails , the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices that took us seven days to us , the week , 24 hours a day , all these negative news is not a miracle we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but possibly this is not the case .
perhaps that &apos;s true .
perhaps the amount of progress we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it will be made us in the next three decades , that it will be possible for us to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying we have no big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- that we have already .
and as humans , we are much better at this , problems for very long , but ultimately , to overcome it .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled , which is the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world population .
child mortality has increased to a tenth .
and it &apos;s coming to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> costs to have a wider higher increase .
steve pinker showed us that we live in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> over 25 percent of 25 percent .
we live in a really remarkable time .
and many people forget this .
and we continue to keep our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have poverty .
think that a lot of the americans who live below poverty poverty are access to electricity , water , water , <unk> , television phones , television phones , air power and cars .
the richest , the last <unk> of the last century , the <unk> of earth , would never have dreamed of this .
so the basis of many of these are <unk> technologies , and these growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that will make information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> rate is doubling all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket has about a million times less than a decade than the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law .
notice two things on this curve .
first , as smooth it goes -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of a faster computer , <unk> computers .
it &apos;s not slowing down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite your <unk> <unk> on the left , it goes up to up .
so the growth of itself is speeding up .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , something that allowed my friends to autodesk on autodesk , synthetic biology , the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , means vaccination , food , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer from watson for risk ?
it was big .
i &apos;ve been looking for the news papers and looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s <unk> human . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the outline of the language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is a <unk> operation to the cost of any <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m here at ted , called singularity university .
we bring all of our students with all of these technologies , focused focused on how these can be used to solve the grand challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to do business and services that can be <unk> by a decade of people by a decade .
think about that , one group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
thirty years ago , this would have ridiculous <unk> .
today , we can now put together dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think about making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about making abundance of total of <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 1700s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he was invited to the king of <unk> for dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> themselves had got <unk> .
but the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
even though , in fact , the most valuable metal thing was on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome is made of aluminum .
even though , even though , <unk> percent of the <unk> are not coming from a <unk> of the <unk> .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made it <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of <unk> more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all <unk> minutes to the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about forestry , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar power costs in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees , compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy fell in the last year .
last month , this is a study published that , in the end of this decade , the united states will grow up to grow six cents a <unk> , compared to 15 cents a year in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , when carl sagan was the <unk> of 1990 , when it was saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered in 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of the saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission of the <unk> -- his <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; means that many of you may have heard of it , it has the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can produce a thousand liters per day from different sources -- whether water , polluted water , <unk> -- and all that for less than two cents a gallon .
the head of coca-cola has just <unk> , a big <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very optimistic , then coca-cola is global global warming globally to apply global global warming in <unk> countries .
this is <unk> innovation that &apos;s available today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , you know , my god , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent of mobile mobile phones in developing countries to end of 2013 .
just remember that a <unk> with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya , has a better <unk> than president of the reagan in the past 25 years .
and if you look at google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton was 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has <unk> information and communication , as no one could ever have predicted .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you &apos;ve spent about a thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical medical imaging -- now will be <unk> and cheaper to your mobile phone .
and the best part of this is possibly what makes us happen in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of the <unk> called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> of x prize . &quot;
we invited teams around the world , all of these technologies share with each other in a cell to connect with the device , because it &apos;s armed with ai , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , it has to be a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of health care .
if this device was a <unk> or a <unk> that doesn &apos;t know , it &apos;s called , &quot; it &apos;s going to be a pandemic and prevents a pandemic in her .
but now , the biggest force we have to lead to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are going to the population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and just by the way , the greatest <unk> against a population is a better upbringing and nutrition around the world .
in 2010 , we had to connect with two billion people online .
by 2020 , we are going to go from two to five billion .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , are going to join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are you going to desire ?
and instead of the destruction of the world , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several <unk> dollars that are going to be going to global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be trained by leveraging health , and they &apos;re getting better trained by the <unk> , and by doing better , that they have the ability to use 3d printers and &quot; <unk> &quot; and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion more , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> are given us ?
how about a sentence of new new , never have <unk> voices .
how do you get the oppressed , wherever you &apos;re to be a voice to make sure and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people ?
how about <unk> , who we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned from the x prize is that small teams that motivated through passion and focus , extraordinary things , can create extraordinary things that are really motivated by the big business and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game , the paradox is called .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , to explore how the protein will be evolving .
so the same thing we can do is predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by professors and so forth .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these days , the human pattern is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and watched who &apos;s the best world in the world , this was not a <unk> , a <unk> , a woman in england , manchester , a woman who was walking as an assistant to the <unk> in a <unk> , and at night , the best <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i have tremendous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have a passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion minds that we can work online to master the new challenges and to do that , to do that .
we expect some remarkable decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have a bit against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s been with a medical medical team , and i &apos;m here .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long enough time , when i can give it to me a piece of my own fake <unk> , giving up this to make this happen .
but before i get to the actual theme of my presentation , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> and moving moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turns around statistics and to use this <unk> team .
i &apos;m going to get a statistics that i hope most of you have already heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat tolls .
that means that the player will be safely three of 10 .
this is called the ball into the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball at first base , didn &apos;t get done in time and the <unk> was in safety .
three from 10 .
do you know how you &apos;re called a <unk> <unk> baseball .
good , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s going to meet four of the 10 four out of the rest .
<unk> -- like ted williams , <unk> , the last <unk> <unk> baseball player , during a <unk> season , over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i &apos;ve been making some more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk to you about this .
suppose you have a <unk> and you &apos;re going to take a <unk> , which is a <unk> 400 in relation to the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine you live in a particular remote neighborhood , and you have a beloved people with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> to this one of these <unk> whose <unk> at <unk> is in 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s a year much better . it &apos;s at the <unk> branch .
and it &apos;s hugging a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
what do you think about the <unk> or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody should be aware of the whole medicine , which should be a good surgeon or a doctor or a <unk> .
but what we do is we &apos;re going to do each of them , including me , to the world , to be the wrong perfect .
never do a mistake , no one does no force to think the details of how this could be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
i was a 24-year-old <unk> student .
in high school , a school scientist said brian <unk> was going to learn a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned to my little <unk> in the sisters of the sisters , <unk> , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and the tail of every branch of one of the <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i knew even the <unk> <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;ve been collecting more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was going to <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school of the impression that i knew anything , and all of this , or as possible , or as much as possible as i could , as i could , i was immune to do this .
and it worked for a time , until i met a printer .
i was <unk> in toronto , a <unk> , in toronto , a woman to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
at this point i was the <unk> layer of <unk> .
and it was my assignment for the <unk> <unk> of the advice to investigate the <unk> .
and there &apos;s a feedback to my <unk> .
i studied a <unk> , she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i was doing their chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides that said she was under <unk> failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of using the entire blood to grow , is a part of the blood vessels in the lung lungs and then fill these up and it &apos;s so <unk> .
and that was not a difficult to <unk> diagnosis .
i hired them and made me the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave medicine to take the pressure off the heart .
i gave medicine , we call water , water pills , so they were the liquid .
and over a year and two hours , they started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i was actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my roommate .
i didn &apos;t pick up and i did what i should have had a call to my <unk> to be a call to my <unk> to <unk> it , so he would have a chance to have a picture of a own picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to have information to her <unk> .
maybe i did good for the reason .
maybe i couldn &apos;t be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility so that i was so much , i would be able to get my patients to contact with it without having to contact with it .
my second error was worse .
so i sent them home , i <unk> a <unk> voice in me to say , &quot; the goldman sachs , not good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was so much about <unk> that i asked the nurse , which was a little bit of a lot of a lot of a lot of time , &quot; believe it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and they took them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i was able to do my things , you get to get the hospital and went to the car park to drive home , when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went home through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse , and he said another nurse , not the sister that had seen the <unk> , but one of the other three words , and those three words , most of the most <unk> i know .
other doctors are not afraid that , but the <unk> is special , because we just see the patient &apos;s patients as well .
the three words , remember , remember ?
&quot; remember the patient , you know , you know ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
so , &quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she arrived at the home , after i was sent her home , she would hit home , and the family called 911 . the <unk> brought them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure from 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous <unk> .
they hardly barely and was <unk> out .
the <unk> was moved all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they adapted to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and to the insides .
and i &apos;m going through this rollercoaster , because she came to the <unk> and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days , we realized that they would never be <unk> .
she didn &apos;t have suffered a <unk> .
their family turned out .
and over the next eight or nine days , they came up with the <unk> .
and the day day , they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you never forget the names of the world .
and this was the first time i learned this .
the next weeks i &apos;ve been saying , and i learned to the first time , the unhealthy <unk> of the biology of the <unk> , which exists , in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolation , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you cannot talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame if you give a secret of the best friend , and then you get a horrible discussion with a given , and my horrible discussion is going to be faced with one of the best friend , but you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you &apos;ve never got a mistake to do that .
if you do it <unk> and never do the mistake again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the amount of food i &apos;m talking about is the ones that make a <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one saying that you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing is bad , but that you &apos;re really miserable .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t about my <unk> , he was very close .
he spoke with the family , and i &apos;m sure that he would make the grip of the grip and secure , i &apos;m not going to be sued .
but i asked myself this question .
why did i not ask the <unk> ? why do i get them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i went into medicine ?
slowly , but it certainly put it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke up , and i could maybe feel better again .
and i was out that if i could raise my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake , that the voice could <unk> .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital , <unk> north of toronto , and i <unk> a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> .
it was much about it and i in a hurry .
he always showed this .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he was coming from the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to talk to a conversation in her office .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember to the patient &apos;s patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out that he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can measure this , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , and causes the <unk> to the <unk> .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt free and went back to the work of the work , and over and over and over again .
i &apos;ve seen two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of things that you have , especially if you consider that you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i sent them home , and there &apos;s probably no shortage of their treatment .
i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the x-ray of the kidneys , when the without <unk> , my colleague , in the <unk> of the patient , i put a <unk> in the lower right , and called the <unk> .
the other had severe diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to report .
and he did , and when he was a <unk> in the right , the other sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was fine .
both of these cases , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to say that my worst mistake only was the first five years of what i &apos;m saying , but i &apos;m a <unk> error .
some of my favorite career happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and without support .
so here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not going to close my mind and talk about you , if i &apos;m going to have the silent voice that i &apos;m saying , what didn &apos;t happen to be able to do , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i was a room , like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear someone &apos;s last time from someone &apos;s <unk> talking about <unk> ?
oh , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t get somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i was a <unk> and start telling them what i just told you about , i would probably not have to do the end of the second story before you really get uncomfortable to you , somebody would joke a joke , &quot; you would not forget about the subject and forget the rest .
and actually , if i or my colleagues know that a <unk> in my hospital someone had lost the wrong leg , they would have to look me , i could have to look at it in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- the ones that are making mistakes and those who don &apos;t make , those who are <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> of bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response to an ideological response that you can attack .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we are the ones that make mistakes in the field of <unk> , that a safety system remains .
but there are two problems with this .
in my about 20 years of the medical prize and journalism , i &apos;ve been making a personal medical study of the medical error and journalism , and i could build a personal medical study of the medical error and journalism , and i was writing a personal medical show .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system where you can get a <unk> in a <unk> system , where you &apos;re either a false or wrong <unk> , in the <unk> always and cause and <unk> and suffers .
in this state , <unk> <unk> of <unk> conviction .
in the united states , the institute of 100,000 , the institute of 100,000 .
they &apos;re both powerful <unk> because we don &apos;t think the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> where the medical knowledge doubled , all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we cannot get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and give it a slightly easy breath and suddenly the story of <unk> .
i don &apos;t take the same .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of that , they &apos;re <unk> .
so if you take the system so i &apos;ve been taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> , you know , there &apos;s no more left left .
and you know the most people who do , they want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black style , &quot; i would say to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; i would say to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; i would show it to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then i show the microphone to it .
and then you pick up your pupils , you &apos;re just pushed back to your head , look down and try and start telling your stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to say to you , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that will make you get in a situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new feature of a doctor is a man , it &apos;s not proud to make sure that you &apos;re not proud to make mistakes , but it &apos;s going to get something from them to learn so that it can be passed on .
she divides their experiences with others .
they supported others when others talk about their mistakes .
and they &apos;re making other minds , not to <unk> , but in an loving , they kind of benefit from all of them .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people can fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s so , then people also make mistakes from time to time .
so the system that we &apos;ve seen is to create <unk> , which is to make sure that the potential of the health care can do , and that &apos;s a potential to be rewarded for it , and it &apos;s even rewards , and that &apos;s a payoff in people like me that make mistakes and to be rewarded for the <unk> .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new defining doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> , but i &apos;m able to learn best to do it , to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about to use time .
the first story about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was <unk> here .
you may think he was <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
he was actually catching fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a <unk> .
and then , until the &apos; 80s , it was being covered in big style .
now , he &apos;s standing on the red list of the blobs .
and this story we have a lot of times from the galapagos or other locations , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we still get to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> describe it still as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to make a different concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i &apos;ve seen it when i was in 1971 to <unk> a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could be engaged .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t really from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was the lagoon of <unk> and some of the <unk> .
there were <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen were good about it and made their total good good .
when i returned , 27 years later , the fish shrunk .
they are five centimeters .
they were genetically modified cones .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the lucky to be there .
so it &apos;s not changed , and it has changed everything .
my third little story , i talked about my <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- the first thing that was the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe .
<unk> , countries that were already 100 fish , the industrial fishing industrial fishing , quite ugly , called <unk> 4 .
i was driving along with and we did all the southern <unk> ocean in the entire southern <unk> , and especially in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
i now know that it was the cause of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the most part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , was <unk> .
basically the bottom of the ocean was on deck and then <unk> .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is going to be very fast .
within a year , you get a survey by the <unk> and then it starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is it &apos;s going to change . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals are <unk> crap .
this is a dead <unk> .
they weren &apos;t eating , they were away , because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t yet <unk> .
they then wanted to kill them , because they could eat good .
in fact , this mountain will be collected from the rubble of the fishermen , when they go into areas they &apos;ve never been covered .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re entering our <unk> of the new level and we don &apos;t have remembered to mind what was there .
if you go through it , this happens .
on the y-axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
and over time , it changes in . it changes because people are their actions very , of course .
every generation of the images they &apos;re at the beginning of their conscious life as standard and will get all of it .
the difference is perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a order of changes .
and the end of the end you want to get the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s now , now , our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not more like they were .
you might think that the problem of people were in , which certainly , when they lived in <unk> societies , animals , and only after a few generations , what they did .
because obviously , an animal that has been very common , except it &apos;s only rarely before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have to lose any of the animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and so it &apos;s not going to be a lot of loss .
and then , with the time we focus on the big animals and the ocean , the big fish are the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be less likely because we &apos;re catching them .
and there &apos;s a little bit of fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
now , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;ll confirm it , because the evidence , as they would be in a previous form , they &apos;re not as much as they would like to make the evidence to the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that shows that the report of a <unk> orchestra that &apos;s been in the area of major <unk> , not <unk> , or not <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientifically . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in inorganic societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
and this is the tremendously big role that can play a marine population .
because in marine marine areas , we basically have the past .
we &apos;ve come back the past , which people can &apos;t understand , because they have changed the <unk> and very low .
so the people who see a marine particle can see the window of the window that allows you to have to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people that doesn &apos;t have to be because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the middle of the west , for example ?
so , i think art and the film might be the gap with , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> , they may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were being touched by the way , the people who are being touched by the way , except , why were they so concerned about the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s been lost in some way .
so my recommendation , so , the only i &apos;m going to give is , it &apos;s cameron to cameron , so he &apos;s called &quot; avatar <unk> . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to be a typewriter , you know , in the state of governance .
they also had to put a sheet with <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason why the government was able to absorb the text text .
and found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could find the creators of the thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , and how much that would be the speech of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new <unk> from the leading <unk> and a page , then this page , yellow yellow strip has <unk> on every page , in a pattern that &apos;s clearly pointing to you and your printer .
this is what happens today .
and it seems like no <unk> .
and this was an example of what wise our own governments are using the technology against us , citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three main dinosaurs .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> in the glasgow galleries .
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make lots of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who have made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is the <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people are coming online , but they &apos;ve been illegal acquired to put money from our <unk> , but they &apos;ve got illegal by using the money from our <unk> , and also <unk> that , and <unk> our <unk> with the keyboard over the keyboard while we put a <unk> computer online .
the american intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account , there were <unk> million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on top of the foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely today , that we &apos;re going to become victims of a <unk> than a standard in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s only going to be worse .
in the future , most of the crime are going online .
the second largest <unk> we &apos;re seeing today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re just motivated by something else , protests , like , it &apos;s like to the audience .
groups like anonymous are actually over the last 12 months and to be one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are <unk> for the money , <unk> how anonymous to do the resistance , but the last group are nations , governments that are breaking the attacks .
there &apos;s cases of time , like <unk> .
it &apos;s a great model that happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had been hacked .
somebody was born and had been hacked the system .
and last week in a meeting , i asked one of the senior senior members of the question , whether it was possible for possible , that because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was yes .
now , how are people dying in a row of a remote physical field ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , you need a certificate , if you have a website with <unk> , you have <unk> with it , for example .
now we all use , or many of us , <unk> , and they &apos;re using foreign services in <unk> states , as the iran who are <unk> foreign fighters are used to be more likely to have more confidence than local <unk> and that they are <unk> in <unk> , so that the local government can &apos;t be able to <unk> in their conversation .
but can you , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the event of <unk> .
how do it compare to the arab spring and things that are happening for instance in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the 2005 were in april of 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian <unk> the headquarters , and they found them a lot of .
in this , a folder was a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , these notes were in germany , the egyptian government had to have been sold some programs that they have to capture -- very large -- any communication that they could have to capture the egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so , the western governments are <unk> governments with <unk> , so that they can do it to their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , only a few weeks ago , had found the <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> that was used by <unk> <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , you &apos;re pretty much secure your phone .
but today , we are far beyond that .
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> your connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> , allowing them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we think about this stuff , the obvious response to the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not really , because i &apos;m a citizen citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy must be .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and while we today , in 2011 , in 2011 , we have trust , but every one that we &apos;re going to make for forever is .
and trust , we trust one of every future government , one government that we might have to be in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> idea : <unk> <unk> , with regard measurements that fit together .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into the able to build things that were bigger than us , building bridges , a stone to the other .
basically , the <unk> was in our time .
for almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , there &apos;s been making out of this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically <unk> . &quot;
and within a few years , lego , in every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion stones are produced by the -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create nice houses , nice bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego for all bets .
lego has made the <unk> , the building block in the world , and it &apos;s made a building block for our imagination .
meanwhile , in the same year , the next year at bell labs labs and the next revolution was missing , the next building block .
the transistor was a small <unk> that we would bring us from a world of static , <unk> building blocks of a world where it would be interactive .
like the <unk> , let &apos;s allow us to build much more , more complex circuits , a pebble after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just experts .
i personally accept that , that the building block of our time for experts is reserved , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea , how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , clay , motor and sensor .
and the best part of it is that they connect with magnets .
so they can &apos;t sit it wrong .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is a copy , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
so all you have to do is to connect a blue and a green one , and you can build bigger <unk> .
they put a blue on a green one , and they can make light .
you can put the switch in between you and so you &apos;ve created a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , which is , put it down , put it up , and you &apos;ve done a little <unk> .
put this <unk> into an extra effect , and you have made a <unk> .
i will stop that .
the simple play is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to code , you have to code , <unk> , or <unk> , allows you to code with simple intuitive gestures .
so to speed up the rate , you get too faster , and it &apos;s just slow down that button , and it makes it faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction on this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread out of kids to kids and see them playing with it .
and it was an unbelievable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how you start to understand the electronics that surrounds them in everyday and they don &apos;t learn to school .
like , for example , the doors works , or why the doors would be reacting to the <unk> , or like an ipod respond to touch .
we also brought <unk> to <unk> .
so we had a designer with no experience in electronic things , trying to play with <unk> and <unk> material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
we had a few weeks ago in risd , we gave them a little bit of designers that had no engineering experience , just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is my favorite one , really my favorite .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-dough that &apos;s fear in darkness .
for those <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so <unk> open source .
you can go to the website , all of the <unk> download and make yourself .
we want to encourage the world of the creators , the inventor , the <unk> , because the world that we live in life , that interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out , they start to invent them .
thank you .
