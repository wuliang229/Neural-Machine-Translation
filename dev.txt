he called them : &quot; massively fatal discontinuity , &quot; which means they could kill millions of people in the next 50 years .
and recently we didn &apos;t need to know how vaccine was right .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re making a huge triumph of science , because they have automated the automated death of a <unk> at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that has been done has been very much about the progress for other diseases .
this was a slow <unk> process that was dependent on <unk> , millions of eggs .
and according to radical production , the great <unk> of e. coli , for example , we &apos;ve just spoken about -- look at the bottom of time -- that would be a life of life .
so the challenge is full force .
the question is just : why ?
do you think african union is going to have a conference like this ?
there &apos;s some things you have to know .
the speaker that came up here on the stage , <unk> muhammad , <unk> on this , that we had <unk> leaders in africa .
by making it from your <unk> people .
traditionally , traditionally , the africans hate to be -- they hate judgment .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get any help from the government , and he builds a second , <unk> boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to be a balance , because they go to the point of what they &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s to <unk> new ideas and to new people and strangers perspectives .
and the man replied , &quot; all of nice things , what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting for other bad <unk> , i &apos;m just kidding -- but now , just a quick peek , and then i &apos;ll show you new material about potential solutions .
and then , to the <unk> , in may , it will be an update on version 2.0 , where you can then get to purchase the purchase of <unk> .
even again , all of the republican here , it should not be about <unk> .
what i really excites about the people on the gulf is that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and there &apos;s no more trying to use a few people who try to use the beach .
we &apos;ve heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this <unk> swim across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor <unk> , they were called at least .
what the most sacred birds is , i don &apos;t want to have a <unk> remarks of <unk> , and about people who are clean .
okay , people who are talking about conservative , if you really want to be really really conservative and really <unk> , you should send these <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
it &apos;s right and wrong .
and i have a system to produce medical spaces .
okay , i &apos;m more than my genes , &quot; -- all in common .
i didn &apos;t ask you to just <unk> it because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
it &apos;s a molecule that we know as a brain .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human <unk> .
now , neurons , as well as trees , can grow new branches and old lose .
and we can even talk about the <unk> .
if you look at this number , you can get easily conclude that there &apos;s a big potential for <unk> in the brain .
perhaps , if this technique will be able to do that we ourselves from ourselves through them and put together in our own brains .
he &apos;s working on music videos and commercials with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;ve got a quick experiment here to show you this .
ks : no , not .
while he did , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : now , how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo .
a huge scandal scandal for weeks .
but he did always make this way .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found this wild plant , the <unk> .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try and try to try .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what &apos;s the hell ?
at least , i think , anyway .
farmers who leave the nature to find solutions to find answers rather than nature solutions to nature .
and from the old to the new fire , means that means two great stories about oil and electricity , which are both given the <unk> of the fossil <unk> .
our fuel for mobility is about three fifth of cars .
you can &apos;t let it calm down , it &apos;s harder to titan .
trucks and planes can use hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
and also , better light and <unk> and so lower <unk> around a third .
and in about 20 , the <unk> <unk> cheap solar cells , and they lower their own resources , they lower their <unk> .
and whatever we replace it is it &apos;s going to replace , in about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we buy more of them , what we have or new nuclear and silicon <unk> , or renewable , which are more or less centralized .
so , in effect , and not incentives , focus , more <unk> and conflict , the <unk> solution is the <unk> solution .
i first realized that what i had to eat , two <unk> of his family was true .
this simple <unk> shows that donor in the areas where the kids go to school , not schools have funded , and this is bringing new questions . get aid aid that they need most need ?
two years ago , on eight april 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
so we remember and we can remember that in every book of my <unk> son , that life emerged four billion years ago -- four billion points of two ?
so similar , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there are traps . they &apos;re dropping . they &apos;re going to be vertical .
you &apos;ve got time thinking about art , you have time to talk about art and those things .
you go back into the future , back , back , back , back , again .
they come all of families , usually , in which most of the time , is just home , or they &apos;re usually , and they come to be training and their structure here .
we bring them to the right , and the left so that they can &apos;t do to obey and the consequences when they &apos;re taking .
let all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s unpredictable .
they said , &quot; this is enough for <unk> .
then you can support us . this is the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my phantom dog .
you can listen and join .
let &apos;s take a look at the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , where you think about the content of <unk> , and at the end , you have created the greatest encyclopedia in the world .
there are lots of people who have the same dream .
a website was built .
there was no leader .
extremism has become a tolerance .
modern tools of neuroscience show us that what &apos;s happening there is an incredibly complex process .
we can hold the sounds of our own language , but not the stranger .
we went to read that by the american babies that never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical phase of <unk> .
it may seem like a <unk> from mars .
science on the side has a very rational way to do this , in art , and in art on the other hand , is usually an emotional response to his surroundings .
now i have a <unk> here to show you this .
let me show you over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the rags were burned by a little girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we do it with compassion ?
the wound &apos;s full of the <unk> .
now , let &apos;s say , you may have a little <unk> , and frankly , who don &apos;t like it ?
we start with a <unk> , and then we &apos;ll ask another <unk> <unk> .
then there was <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i &apos;m like , &quot; he &apos;s already a long dead .
&quot; did i have a <unk> ! &quot; i don &apos;t get a memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby , and i saw this indian guys .
marco tempest : if you asked him a deception , he said , &quot; a magic is the only job .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how deeply terrorism connected with our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that their lives were not about ideology and politics , but it &apos;s man-made pressures .
i think a lot of people thought i was a little <unk> .
but mostly they went into serious <unk> with organized crime .
this money was made in <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- a bar , understand .
no one wants the <unk> to control his world and his <unk> with customer .
some of you might think , &quot; wait a minute . it doesn &apos;t necessarily look like a <unk> .
i mean , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t know , was that the definition of extremely innocent is to leave his <unk> .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the greater the feeling of a special performance , if you get to the end .
now , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really very big .
but it didn &apos;t go without <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green layer on the horizon , which makes you very nervous about rising sea level .
we can start to make better , <unk> , more sustainable decisions .
<unk> <unk> : why i &apos;m going to go across the pacific
this is the world trade <unk> on the front page .
why ? why ? why would you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t even see any of the cost . he doesn &apos;t spend any extra time .
they were able to make that .
and then it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about that you feel good at places you haven &apos;t really much felt about it .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to get someone <unk> , and one day , i said , &quot; sure , i can <unk> my homework <unk> , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i had writing in the night .
we &apos;re both in the back benches in the class so we couldn &apos;t go with <unk> <unk> .
maybe you have brought your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never told them , because how can you say yourself if everyone is pointing around you ?
this is french science .
all right , then go .
if you look at these trucks here , it &apos;s the largest <unk> of its earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest-growing is the largest growing source of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also why canada are now the number three , in terms of <unk> per capita .
and as a parent , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing .
by doing this , we remove a big portion of our biggest <unk> and replacing them with most greenhouse oil flow of the future .
the <unk> of her work is the <unk> that you can buy in any store and the millions of indian women can put every day on their forehead , and it &apos;s a ritual that fits tightly with the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw was born in <unk> , in <unk> , and trained in london .
i hope you can persuade them that complex and complicated aren &apos;t always the same .
the <unk> <unk> is the one that we want to affect , the public support for the government .
so i suggested in my first tedtalk that we should spend billions of hours a week a week .
only 30 minutes of <unk> a day , for a significant improvement , mood and <unk> increase in joy .
why a game ?
how could such a <unk> game such a huge effect that so severe , sometimes <unk> situations ?
there are four ways of strength or <unk> that are contributing to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically scientifically <unk> things that you can do to do this resilience , you don &apos;t need a trauma .
more practice is going to be empowered .
here &apos;s a secret to you : if you shake someone your hand , you will shake your blood in your blood , the <unk> in your blood , goes strong , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this project , we &apos;ve actually got hundreds of people around the world , and they do this with us , actually , with thousands of people on this project , in many of his different aspects .
and then some people from chicago and said , &quot; end of chicago , the slogan of chicago was <unk> festival , global warming . we have a <unk> of square gallery and we want you to fill them with your reef . &quot;
wool and <unk> are not just two concepts that fit good .
and then , <unk> said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . it &apos;s just captured .
so we have , so we have to be satisfied , <unk> <unk> , the evidence that the most famous <unk> of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual notions , and their engagement with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> property -- the self -- is the ultimate grail of neuroscience , the neuroscience , and eventually we will hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is a way , a <unk> understood and intelligent . but if he sees his mother , grabs his <unk> and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if that area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and <unk> -- nothing happens in normal people , and if i show him a picture of his mother , the most <unk> activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . it &apos;s all , it &apos;s a compelling , <unk> experience .
maybe you can solve the <unk> , the higgs boson , the phantom .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days , i had no phantom , and therefore , no <unk> , no longer , no , no , no <unk> in the <unk> . all my pain are gone .
<unk> is blue , <unk> is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
what is kiki , which is buba ?
their <unk> is to <unk> , which most of us don &apos;t deal with .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;ll see in this video are <unk> .
well done .
he learned that if he has both hands , with his <unk> <unk> , much more and more <unk> .
a framework is a hut in the woods .
does he look where the sound comes from ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that are all of the remains .
on the right , the gravity is gravity . einstein explained this .
and beyond that , they get new kinds of change .
it was still too early on , but he was a moral guide , a inspiration , a inspiration that worried about the control of the armed weapons .
suppose we have been in , <unk> creatures , we would have seen our <unk> point from far outside the cosmos , but for 40 years , but it &apos;s been the whole year of the earth &apos;s whole year .
martin rees : is this last century ?
and it &apos;s even worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and a dozen <unk> .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like <unk> and make-up .
and then we asked them again , how happy they were .
but enormous different incentives .
this is <unk> in belgium .
the teams we gave up to each other , to spend it , they were teams , and they actually live in the league of the <unk> .
if we hear about the <unk> , the high <unk> , will often believe that this is another one of these <unk> conflict in the middle east , that &apos;s the way that the region itself are .
ironically , it was a time when the <unk> of iran was supposed to peace with washington , not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that inspires to be based on , the diplomacy ends up , is inevitable .
you can look for certain <unk> , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port-au-prince <unk> at the end of 2009 were not as good as they could have , not as good as the map of california .
the trick .
and to the point , she goes , &quot; he was not an environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , and the status quo is a <unk> government .
so it &apos;s not that my topic is most important . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , you need to get the republic .
for example , some people in this room are very much to be a grant to school .
anyway , this is anyway on my pencil . &quot;
each is just a little bit of <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here &apos;s the dawn of the <unk> .
if you see in north america , the ones are like so many things in the united states independent from each other . they ignore each other .
everybody &apos;s <unk> depends on this critical region , the <unk> , which is about 10,000 independent cells , which every <unk> , a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low -- to send a signal to the pump .
they were a while in synchrony , but they were going apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who were going to open up to the bridge , and describe what was happening .
now , don &apos;t you ever hold on a metronome , but we &apos;re walking all -- we &apos;re going to <unk> and go back to the run .
am : the one weighs a few tons , so you &apos;re going right fast .
but the most enterprising scientist in his field .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in <unk> , and i told them , they should look for their names , their <unk> , or the <unk> of their mother .
and also , perhaps this <unk> , or perhaps a <unk> , which is worth economic not worth , a resilience against disease or pests or a different characteristic that is useful for climate change and the other ones .
we &apos;re going to see children in television .
the idea of finance was that it &apos;s cold there , so you have natural temperatures under the <unk> .
and if anything happens , you can get it up and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your posture ! this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? -- thank you .
you just try out two ideas , and you &apos;ve got two in the united states , and one of the russian .
madness ! i have to talk briefly about innovation innovation -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced with something and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my heart .
i mean something interesting here is going to happen here .
okay , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of space flight .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has an epiphany .
institutions will be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , it has consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle , is <unk> .
the one is from the <unk> .
you know , bees and fish live in .
all over us , there &apos;s been a medical revolution , a revolution that will help us , some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer , including cancer .
this is a cancer , dark , gray , a <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the supply chain is going to be avoided .
but the real question is : how good work is in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> to add angiogenesis in very effective way .
but more interestingly , from the study , the study is that the men who developed the <unk> developed , so they have developed more tomato sauce , actually , they had fewer blood vessels that have their cancer .
albert <unk> once said that , &quot; discoveries are about seeing what everybody has seen , and think what nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a <unk> in discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike any other problems that honestly , frankly , are not really good at solving .
one is the background of the other .
you may not physically do that , but on a computer it &apos;s over to the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
in which direction , what are the ones that are going to fall ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain &quot; for the nintendo , <unk> .
looks like a black figure . where is this ?
i really believe that a girl is so powerful that we all had to train , not to be like that .
i remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very violent was me .
we &apos;re so used to to reconnect with girls , <unk> of their own life that we actually made objects of objects and they &apos;ve been transformed into objects .
and she looked in her baby and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , she has taken a ritual that they were girl who are <unk> with their families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side for the rest of your side . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take things to do things .
why should you want to <unk> me , <unk> ?
so , in fact , all six teenagers , <unk> the <unk> that they did by the photo array .
but the incident was in the middle of the january , in the northern hemisphere , to wake up 7 o &apos;clock .
ten meters away .
and what is this case of this example -- what &apos;s important to keep us in mind ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and i went to africa a year by africa , where i asked people why they built this , which is a great job if you can get it .
and this is going to be in some of the villages in some level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would use a long time , because it &apos;s very quick , and it &apos;s very cheap .
just odd makes odd .
we have a <unk> in ghana .
the bad news is .
instead of trying to turn to friends or relatives , they looked at their work .
today , <unk> development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to go up to the <unk> .
fear of <unk> , they do go to sleep .
we put some rules on and keep it on them .
the conversation is going to run better . &quot;
just when i was going to get here tonight , i started to get here , started a <unk> of my daughters .
and we were going to have a bit of <unk> .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna <unk> &quot; and the famous sentence was , &quot; all happy families are equal to each other .
i want to show you how something is that beautiful to look at .
if i &apos;ve come into water here , you see a <unk> <unk> and this <unk> is the <unk> that &apos;s the water from the <unk> &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s dry .
and plato with all of the young boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;ll show you .
but tesla &apos;s not been successful .
one thing that i want to be clear is not all <unk> <unk> .
we can <unk> them or turn them on or down , on or a <unk> .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can use it in the circuits that are learning about depression .
we are to grasp what these circuits are and the areas of the world &apos;s clinical symptoms and symptoms of those illnesses are responsible .
the evolution is actually actually working more like a <unk> than an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is whether you look at the leg of a man &apos;s leg , or a <unk> or a <unk> , the relative <unk> of this feather , is the same for all that we &apos;ve seen .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible students , and they couldn &apos;t tell it .
he &apos;s doing this with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and they put it together with another colleagues of berkeley .
realizing that by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , two thirds of the most <unk> men have children , but only one third of the women &apos;s women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it run ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard medical school , who was called heidi <unk> .
and i have my hand back to <unk> , and i noticed that in all other women , and then you have more questions , just from men . &quot;
and a woman approached me in this , and i looked at them -- she saw something like a little bit .
thank you .
they don &apos;t usually do it as they should , but they do .
so not fear was the most exciting factor .
but it &apos;s true in the black .
now , i want to talk about this , thinking about how we spread from this country of information , how we get to information .
so , you &apos;re in <unk> , more clearly , language . and that works .
we say everything is fine ; it &apos;s all right .
so this patient is 50 , we can pretty much say exactly what big risk is to get prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need to have the <unk> of the audience in this room .
and this bee is certainly assumed , &quot; i &apos;m going to take this <unk> , these bloom , i &apos;m going to get the nectar and then i go off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , which is my favorite subject , how does the idea of <unk> ?
all right , we &apos;re all equally <unk> .
the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : pretty new , <unk> , even i could have a <unk> <unk> of 10 charge of 10 charge of <unk> .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass is going to be on these <unk> , and it &apos;s happening immediately , something interesting happens .
and now i say , i &apos;m going to build a layer layer on top of the world , but this isn &apos;t quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if you don &apos;t , it &apos;s a pity . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come to a certain time , get rid of it , get it to half .
and then you can get different kinds of things in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a community of dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve been talking about the last time of a couple of years ago .
you can also see , if i turn this around here -- i &apos;m not going to shake the world too much .
you can see here , here &apos;s it .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who was supposed to be <unk> students , discovered the law of the <unk> , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
this is a place where it &apos;s fun to work .
and so the thing that we work on , and we &apos;ve even got people who are excited about it and crazy enough they work on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel said , as he said , had to be done for his passengers , the experience of being in the landscape .
what does life easier , enjoyable ?
and part of the <unk> , they used to build a great new tool , they used one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems has become the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s become part of the problem .
and as brunel can we do , by using our systems , a major effect .
and i was startled by my <unk> , the waiter with his boss .
mark <unk> , and i &apos;ve tried to answer this question from studies , to answer that question .
and yet it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm needs .
but for the <unk> , the sudden availability of all these <unk> on the market is like a <unk> .
americans even discover that vital choices in theory seems more true than in practice .
<unk> parents would be more likely to say , &quot; <unk> was just for such short days , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said that , &quot; it &apos;s the poetry that lost the translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant <unk> of pink . &quot;
so , three problems have one together : they are <unk> problems that are controlled by the natural forces .
so , thank you .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition with collaboration .
and then we build a <unk> , which we can test the <unk> of the machines , and so we can get very quick .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the <unk> <unk> will not be understood as a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the <unk> enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear power holders would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles philharmonic .
then you take it and put it on the screen of your television and you &apos;re bouncing around the outside , right .
if you replace the word &quot; the &quot; or the web of the internet , it &apos;s very clear that his perception is now very <unk> . listen to it .
i think it was that collaboration that has led to personal personal .
ph : i hope you &apos;ll grasp it , like <unk> .
and finally , the race race has won momentum to the future than the phone company .
mm : because it has given the audience to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television is built , which is built , is a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have two industries and new ways of thinking about it .
this is an spanish architect and designer .
color can <unk> <unk> , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it gave me an suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about and build a few installations .
the effort that the city has been carrying for the day is significant , almost an international model .
even the bits of the airplane had french .
he said , &quot; well , first there &apos;s more girls . &quot;
and that was the end of the way i , after some <unk> and <unk> , in the design of the chair , i &apos;m going to show you .
he said , they have one of the new , better chairs .
or they pull them up in the position .
but i knew from experience and when i was <unk> in the offices , where there were <unk> <unk> , that never anyone would come to the idea of creating <unk> , to turn on a <unk> and turn the headrest to get them in position .
and then , the <unk> has spread .
two days or yesterday , i cannot remember that , i &apos;ve read a <unk> to a <unk> , that <unk> has the first <unk> <unk> , about 52 feet of cases , with about 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so it doesn &apos;t spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males , a lot of <unk> .
so , multi-touch machines are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time i take a little bit of the time i take a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
look at the available data .
well , our mobile phones now can now build a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
the simple reason that no one &apos;s talking about it .
as the beginning , the <unk> are , they &apos;re phosphorus from water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a <unk> of nature , which is the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
80 percent of them are going to go to the way .
and instead of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology , and one of which is going to be <unk> in <unk> use some of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re doing to the world of the world .
and he was a called <unk> : all of the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this case you see that the individual steps , but they &apos;re repeating , without being <unk> .
as an architect , i think about relationships between the figures and the whole , but in terms of design , it &apos;s always a matter of business .
we &apos;re going to <unk> us on the level of the <unk> of the building , where we could build five separate towers , but they should all join the 60 floor to a single <unk> mass .
again , we come back to back a few years later , and a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape was actually going to look like <unk> , as soon as a rainforest .
the difference is particularly in <unk> in the desert , or maybe <unk> <unk> in <unk> , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that are illegal and now to be on the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by <unk> , the huge problems of water quality , in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important <unk> for <unk> .
but we can do that and there &apos;s opportunities .
so , irrigation is the biggest contributor to the <unk> .
to work together .
so , what is the system of system that &apos;s inside ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
all system is not going to provide taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological yield to enhance these <unk> .
so this is what it looks like .
we &apos;re <unk> , or <unk> the nerve , from little parts of the <unk> , and let &apos;s give other pristine , we gave us our <unk> -- signal , two others that we put our hand in our hand -- giving signals .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put a lightning and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and this is our goal to have something to have a little more <unk> .
this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
in sub-saharan africa , these conditions are largely , there &apos;s 22 million people living with hiv , which are estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are hiv-infected .
governments need to have to create effective <unk> for ethical aspects of the various world , which are authorized in the various world , <unk> , who are authorized , the government and the <unk> of the study .
the fundamental problems we are faced is , is a high consumption and a lot of people .
so they all meet the criteria that would normally like to people .
so you see this power that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> , and this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , in the galapagos .
we also know that not only are threatened by the <unk> , but also the magellanic penguins and other <unk> .
i want to show you that penguins are going to be pulled in <unk> .
turbo has <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , and we put it in and he &apos;s coming in here .
and then there &apos;s another thing that &apos;s going to get tired of <unk> .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our fundamental political geography .
the two pieces of it is a pretty long threshold .
again , like the mongolia fall , china &apos;s emitting russia . it <unk> it .
for <unk> countries , china will reduce reducing the <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia can sell and be cheaper to be cheaper , and from <unk> to china .
what i want to introduce you to you here is , i call <unk> , day a day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza <unk> .
most of you .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of europe union looks next ?
53 <unk> and the other people who are falling out lines on the map .
this dream is <unk> .
is it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone <unk> is that growth .
so , how can a hormone , then , the speed of aging ?
we think of insulin and igf-1 hormones , which is especially in the most effective circumstances -- in good times -- if food is there , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the detail about how it works , but we know that foxo gene has a impact on people &apos;s lifespan .
and in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve been talking about is , which is going to happen in the worm , which is going to happen in a worm , another normal <unk> , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see a kind of ad , because nike want to say you buy your shoes .
they all show heroes , they were <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to run a <unk> .
this view is that many <unk> <unk> , like prozac , essentially , as prozac as the brain change the brain , as if it was indeed the brain of the container of chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s also .
and the <unk> we found was that a pneumonia , much more needed to go after the <unk> , and when we put the genes that in this mutation were a role , we could find a <unk> .
and this question , you &apos;ve got a long time to put people in the people , but at flies , we can actually test it .
so , you find out in the dark , you find us in the dark , by looking at us . it &apos;s smell us .
just so you see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
and even people , i actually told you that they &apos;re now like to be bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time i felt the most <unk> <unk> of prisoners behind me .
and like <unk> , fat is one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
as we speak , they &apos;re running around clinical trials for <unk> stem cells for <unk> stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have these angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if that &apos;s what &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s going on .
and i can &apos;t tell you about this , because i &apos;ve stopped at the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what they don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these brushes , with the help of material , that dna is encoded in dna .
the animal is jumps , it &apos;s spreading out of its wings , it &apos;s spreading out , but it can &apos;t really catch up , because the fly between two <unk> is trapped .
for a smart creature like our fly , they don &apos;t set up the rule in stone , but it changes as the animal learns by experience .
and through many of these experiments , we were able to do the identity of the critic &apos;s identity of <unk> to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the <unk> and the artificial intelligence you could do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example , how intelligent behavior of physical interactions are affecting living matter .
here &apos;s an amazing process , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : all right . tb : okay . a little bit of a seat , a little more .
in my experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my <unk> from legacy .
one of the things i tell you , this kind of <unk> , which is all about to account from their goals to their genes , will be the most profitable thing we &apos;re going to see in our health care system .
they don &apos;t stick as a <unk> or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> .
what would happen if you climb up the bottom of the <unk> and then it would come up or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so <unk> did . and he does this .
of course , in a <unk> , of course , if you would see that in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at rising sea level .
and i would say that people are working in the oceans and thinking about the goals , we &apos;re thinking about much lower .
this is the ship that i was in antarctica and three months of antarctica .
if that ice is melting level level level to be six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is the coral in the galapagos islands .
their relationship is water .
but then you see the <unk> in black .
we have very interesting ways of the programming level in the atmosphere , billions of years we &apos;ve done this with <unk> , but in this case we go back 20 million years .
and this is the job that einstein has asked : to figure out how gravity works .
einstein had already room and time , warps and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the fabric of the room , so the idea could we give more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a suitcase , you can vibrate , you can vibrate the <unk> of the threads in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that might be able to explain some of the <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually see these extra dimensions ?
so we have two panels on the colored points .
now , can you see the predator , you know , what is it ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is true to all of the information .
and we &apos;re looking at 30 seconds , which is a pretty hammer , in a 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because if the one was in shadow , and the same amount of light on your eye would reflect on the back of the shadow , you should think more -- just after the laws of physics .
how do you know ?
and she comes in the hive , you find a empty <unk> and <unk> -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
often there &apos;s no right or wrong .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we are also a species of storytellers .
now , some things : understanding of security , the risks , the dangers , the <unk> , the way they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the amount of risks we face .
think about cancer , avian flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> , by making data that we &apos;re going to embrace the data that we disagree with and then acknowledging the data to the rest of our <unk> .
i trust one group , realizing my airplane was going to be safe to fly .
these are people who are <unk> .
and he was found here in the past , at stanford .
they had good teaching their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about finding out if that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took a seat to get any of them to get them or rescue , to rescue or rescue me as a volunteer , but i found that nobody did .
we opened the first stage of 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups were very often , &quot; terrorists &quot; .
it needs a <unk> process , which can be very complicated with the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that , probably for the first time in the arab world , a revolution in the ground , is a <unk> .
paradox is that the <unk> decade was so promising . and it &apos;s out of a main reason .
in once , the ngos &apos; branding are not just called the streets -- they took them into negotiations , in part , because they were victims of these guns .
thank you very much .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> &quot; is good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy , a new <unk> operation .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the <unk> , they come right to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit a little bit nervous because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we &apos;re going to think differently about cancer , to a audience that many people have to think about cancer , a lot more than i do .
the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s been a huge amount of information in genetics , by simply comparing the genetic similarity .
and i like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good connected . &quot;
so we basically measure every <unk> as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some <unk> .
where we really need to get , is the process that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s on the level of the <unk> activities on the level of the body , why not cure itself , how he normally does ? &quot;
danny hillis : cancer .
they &apos;re all members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough enough to give up these people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
that &apos;s their lobby .
there was no plan . never before somebody did something like this .
in fact , martin luther king <unk> was a sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting there in this chair , and i &apos;m doing nothing . &quot;
and suddenly they took the <unk> and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re going to throw this little bits of plastic up to the top .
these are <unk> or <unk> <unk> , who are designed to make just so much of the time to <unk> the control for the ground , they were not as permanent buildings .
they <unk> the stability and security , which can give an uncle &apos;s an uncle , you compare them to the <unk> construction of a <unk> niece in high high school .
but my perspective has compassion , it &apos;s a problem .
and it &apos;s the most potent form of <unk> gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he &apos;s not .
stories like these , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that will be willing to bring compassion to the <unk> of the suffering that could otherwise be otherwise .
it was also a really <unk> man .
and the first day we had our <unk> <unk> and taught us our slogan , which we had to go to the rest of the summer to make the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of your known .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group , without the <unk> &apos; opinion to mimic others .
so this is the world that we live in today .
and so i &apos;m going to try to learn from my grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s own way of my grandfather &apos;s own .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine this , you &apos;re going to imagine an inner image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , and unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no secondary school education .
and so we think that through all the changes that are happening , we have incredible opportunities to meet today .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s been able to <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we &apos;ve got to connect now 30 different technologists , and we were able to do , we &apos;ve been able to connect to the last of the way , to connect millions of people , in the way that we need this particular market , needs to have to do .
and at my <unk> father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember you again , every generation of doing it better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very smart , and yet , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with a different family in 1980 together .
don &apos;t you think we have the responsibility to take advantage seriously ? &quot;
i &apos;ll always drive the same four years old ford , as well .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
this is what he &apos;s praying .
if you believe it or not , doesn &apos;t make any difference for me .
so he said , &quot; what do you think ? &quot;
so what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball is about your identity , which you are .
when my kids were little , i always went to bed her room , put me on her bed and looked at my own children .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i &apos;m going to go to 10 to 10 million -- but nonetheless it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , each one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village of all of a sudden has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
and you answer the question , how does it feel like you &apos;re going to be <unk> ?
we really learn that really bad lesson really well .
think about a moment how it &apos;s like to feel right .
and unlike all other animals , we are obsessed with , trying to figure out out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly <unk> book about a subject that everybody hate to , for a audience that would never be .
it &apos;s not just <unk> <unk> wheat , but mountains of <unk> .
in 1986 , they came from vietnam to america .
and the answer was <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank on a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , our <unk> has tripled .
and bhutan , for which it doesn &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy in the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we often go to the west , the happiness of being sent away , as if you get happiness , it would be something that we must capture , or maybe also , some things that we have to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can impact the <unk> of the production of the production , so that our employees can make our own calling .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
underneath the deck , you &apos;re going to say that you &apos;re going to move . but the eyes move in unison with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m still standing . &quot;
amy , come up , please come up ?
the way that did you do ? the outcome : what did you see ?
i &apos;m just reading one .
real scientific education should be the people who are giving a voice and empower them to express them , and so that &apos;s the last word in this short story .
poor people have not have this choice of choice .
we were <unk> in the &apos; 70s .
and to come there , we have to recognize that the principle of a <unk> is not just the kind of damage that we &apos;ve been talking about , but also our society <unk> society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody has ever asked you , &quot; yeah , great things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis system , and i got a lot of attention to that , and that allowed me to finance the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people ask themselves , &quot; <unk> mobile .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where not <unk> , they &apos;re a step toward the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the selfish toxins in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s called &quot; <unk> death . &quot;
i was just months later , who he was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we &apos;ve redefined the hope over again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly , he knows that he has been defeated .
to give you this , we need to put it back on the line .
we <unk> the field , we sent people into , we sent people into , we <unk> the buildings , the <unk> , and we helped to the first <unk> , and the rescue .
if i do this , i don &apos;t get the original <unk> . i could write a story here .
you &apos;re going to be the <unk> of the public opinion .
it &apos;s not very good .
and that &apos;s a democracy of democracy .
and here &apos;s the question : what country does make you better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a benefit of two years from the indian woman .
what political change is , they &apos;ve introduced <unk> .
china , so i think still has been some pretty , <unk> <unk> -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equity that &apos;s not in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now you have the problem that you spent all the money in order to do help with this advanced electronics in these countries and now everything is <unk> .
a little chaotic environment , where probably many ideas were made , where people were more new , interesting , <unk> controversies -- people are different from us .
about a decade or two , a wonderful <unk> , howard <unk> , and she was reading darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re <unk> with their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t think about it .
does it go the other way around ?
in the 1970s , it was a &quot; 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be in summary in terms of crony capitalism , which is a group of good interconnected , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
while you can &apos;t see the very simple things , like globalization and technological revolution , this global rule of money , is it much harder to judge it .
so they spend unprecedented amounts of time and resources to train their children .
we &apos;ve created modern <unk> .
that &apos;s his little hand .
one of them are going to die of one .
that was a huge <unk> for us , because we thought we were a new development .
i even think that in places like oregon , where you can take a <unk> <unk> and try to swallow a <unk> , only half half people have ever done it .
so , for a long time , it &apos;s been to say : they came to canada .
but i was hearing cancer as the most <unk> disease of our time , like , <unk> , like the good and the bad together ?
and some articles went to be so far that <unk> was resistant to cancer , and beyond that , not just against cancer , but it &apos;s not to spread metastases in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s that there were these <unk> tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what <unk> that skeletal muscle is to be able to control angiogenesis , able to control the tumors that these vessels for themselves .
this is a very widespread idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then i left my translator .
she was the girl , which was in the breaks the other for their team .
and the same thing i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had had son for 11 years .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator . &quot;
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all over korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time above the dictionary .
so i just zip the window , look out , and see how flames from the side of the hotel in the height , and the hotel is on .
so we ran into the bath , took it , and i would lay them faces and the children .
until the adoption of it is , a year ! what does it take for long ?
this is their <unk> .
this is sydney , who &apos;s going to be three years ago in a few days .
but there was no evidence .
there &apos;s small planets , there are bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets .
but there &apos;s still a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon , so , it &apos;s a chemical phenomenon , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , which is the point is that the science is that life , and how we know it , to be <unk> .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look at the uganda of uganda and zimbabwe <unk> , russia had a percent .
they find the highest hiv rates in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at this , kenya .
it might be something else , which is what makes transmission possible .
we know about <unk> billion people have ever lived .
it wasn &apos;t just a major story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s also with institutions .
you have to just eat me . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions , future billions , just in 2016 , when the united states is to lose its place as a number one economy in china .
no , we &apos;re probably going to be <unk> , despite the enormous <unk> we &apos;ve mapped , regardless of the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical team .
niall , thanks .
there are lots of spider silks .
spider silk is almost entirely composed of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are quite diverse .
and also , a very high potential for their ability to pay for their ability to do .
what i want to do is not to do the <unk> , so lovely it may be , but the photos .
you have to have physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
that sounds strange about your ears , but what &apos;s happening is that 80 percent of the <unk> have contributed to a lot of the population .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is instantly changing by whatever goal .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there &apos;s people in the states , the <unk> trying to figure out whether or not journalists , or not .
it was built by using their <unk> , using many of these tools , analyzed , no , the intelligence of the world today the same work for the attacks in the last week .
you have <unk> , which is probably probably the most of the most exciting part of bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because <unk> is made out of fibers .
everything is in its place . first plane .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s take a look at the different steps , and you see the <unk> of the possible connections to a deeper level -- my search is about being a question of the question , &quot; what is so special bread ? &quot;
that &apos;s transformation , two different things .
and when they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove that they are alive and creating character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of <unk> of every beer .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of <unk> , as we &apos;re working through this talk .
it &apos;s very , very long to write these scores , and i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s been working on a piece , and that &apos;s a big part of my life , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to work with my hair .
it &apos;s demonstrated by brian <unk> , who &apos;s an extraordinary artist .
that &apos;s a little <unk> of the piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave them two dishes with eating a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a bowl of <unk> <unk> .
and i mean , in the end , if we look at babies , they seem quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies of each species .
the <unk> is to make it hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : that .
our consciousness about this thing is going to be extremely bright and vivid , and everything else is like dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and the <unk> of the human species , &quot; the <unk> alison <unk> <unk> . its research has studied , as babies , during playing sophisticated information and make decisions .
so , for a moment , if i could just rent you for a little demonstration to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
and then you repeatedly this process always repeated over and over again , and something <unk> out in this case , in this case , is the figure , like i &apos;m walking straight .
what we really wanted was the entire human body .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes that i have .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
some of the studio is already using our software to do that , and we &apos;re going to have to get some of our <unk> in some of our <unk> in some big <unk> .
we thought it was just going to be balance .
here you learn to go to the <unk> -- as most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened to me 13 years old .
i believe art and creativity are really critical for creating empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , you write a new york times column , you get hundreds of emails , most of which i achieved today , is <unk> from frustration .
some stories are just too , and yet that &apos;s it .
it <unk> . nobody has ever bought it .
there &apos;s a limit that we don &apos;t want to pass , and so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new empty document in word -- that could be in the word .
but i think there &apos;s actually two <unk> .
the other products were supported by microsoft to an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard .
and <unk> , if somebody write a <unk> -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; screw it . &quot;
but when i looked at the <unk> technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the world , i made the digital technologies , i made very big worried about the <unk> .
and to cut the risk of these new things , we ultimately need to limit the ability to the individuals that they have to have access to the <unk> of evidence .
i think the challenge we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m sure that &apos;s going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to be the challenge , is we &apos;re going to create these <unk> with the background that will make us use this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , like <unk> , you have all kinds of incredible qualities .
and to get you a sense of the last of a small public fund , it &apos;s <unk> to 400 million dollars , which is quite remarkable for us .
and if you &apos;re going to be bigger , you can use a much more nuanced entity , the entity of market , to use feedback , to use feedback .
12 years ago , i was fascinated by <unk> , and i <unk> my research .
wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice underneath the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
even so much energy in biology in this cave , there &apos;s actually a large number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many characteristics that were used by the people and other organisms .
whenever you get a goal of <unk> , you need to break down into certain steps , some way to go back .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> were made by that , and it suffered from tremendous <unk> .
that means before we could start to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the speed of light around , they &apos;re going to take it off .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> of <unk> , a son named alexander the big , and it &apos;s lost the battle of <unk> .
because the moment , the data is <unk> , and that &apos;s a little bit more .
the original <unk> of the bottle was one of the most <unk> <unk> of the 18th century .
i asked myself , &quot; $ hundred dollars for something like that ?

i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object i couldn &apos;t get in the finger , and this was the <unk> cheval cheval .
and i cannot -- call my taste the one of the <unk> -- so it &apos;s not necessarily important that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only there , with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold for <unk> real dollars .
and this really interesting thing about virtuality in virtuality is that you can measure them .
now , i could create a game called <unk> , by just making a million pies or a thousand pies .
if you &apos;re real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality is it &apos;s amazing .
and i want to tell you a quick story , in 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s how powerful engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological insights that we get when we watch people play .

this is a <unk> i got two years ago , which was one of the biggest projects i and my company was involved .
but i &apos;m going to just go back to the beginning of the process , on three very <unk> .
if we are so good , what we should do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to avoid an architectural manifestation that will completely shake and <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
the architectural practices was , <unk> , simple .
and this is the actual <unk> .
the second technology we were using , because we use things that you know about the <unk> of an opera .
here you see the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk today about how to collect stories , something in a little bit .
one of these projects is about a year and a half .
these are the images that are automatically making .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . you know , go ahead .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if you were to just found the truth , what would you do about the next 35 years of your life ?

and with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then it &apos;s confined to communications .
very funny people , if lol is that .
you don &apos;t do that .
if anyone had seen a black board on 1993 , the <unk> would have been a little bit different since the time of love , &quot; but he understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week at the whitney , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan provides no such an existential threat for global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> optimism .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success to the big part of our humility -- in the careful , in the careful , in our own sense of <unk> .
rory , you &apos;ve talked to the end .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to make a difference in what it looks like .
there are also <unk> , the <unk> , but if you &apos;re <unk> these <unk> , this is a different kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a hard problem that i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to make a lot of information on a general way , to lead to a general bad problem .
so , i think it &apos;s got the minimal food that we can probably reach to make things .
and we decided we should not think about it as much as the costs of thinking about the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that is called &quot; what &apos;s the most pessimistic of the <unk> ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t do the other people who are not as you as yourself .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half when i say that you in the hospital you will not believe you when you arrive at a missing bar , you have no previous <unk> , mri and <unk> .
then bell went to his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , early 20th century , suddenly the doctor &apos;s office , trying to make a diagnosis , the <unk> .
between the patient &apos;s perception and the doctors in terms of the best health care system is a real contradiction .
also , another experience i did in texas , before i went to stanford , influenced me .
the bad news is the exact cause of us , and see ? that &apos;s what you can do , we can do that . &quot;
i remember so many big , <unk> , <unk> eyes that <unk> with this ritual .
some call us <unk> , a more <unk> term .
in this case , we have been called .
for you , for you , here &apos;s the back here , here &apos;s a miracle !
and there was no way to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
more difficult is to move dead to the people .
my friend simon <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , wrote the book &quot; the big bang . &quot;
and now they open their eyes .
you can open it completely open , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it has me thinking about that , that these guys , at least most , know what they do for a living .
all of this thought that was impossible .
you can create any amount of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people would have thought of history .
you don &apos;t need everybody .
the <unk> <unk> has invented the <unk> and middle class in venezuela . he only did .
and so it goes on .
they connect people together .
the reason that today &apos;s modern modern medicine is now used for 60 years old .

my experience with the islamic world is quite different .
there &apos;s kind of the character , the character .
and why does sex come to babies , and why do babies mean in relationships of a erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the <unk> .
especially important in this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting , is that there &apos;s no <unk> in desire .
this is your <unk> and <unk> , that &apos;s biology , the natural instinct .
and then there &apos;s all start to desire . this is a curiosity for curiosity .
you know there &apos;s a <unk> space that &apos;s heard of everybody alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
this is mostly played in smaller rooms .
so , early <unk> , some places are <unk> .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for design , that <unk> that we &apos;re doing practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s where it &apos;s got me !
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring to the language ?
albert einstein , i &apos;m just talking to somebody when i was talking to a speech , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s it on life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a talk or a lecture .
and there were about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian , two centuries later , &quot; rare , you have a lot of powerful mind with such a humility of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he said .
i &apos;m not going to <unk> the <unk> over the <unk> .
but for that , you &apos;ve got to sit around 10 minutes and put a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i never had in .
harvest <unk> .
i was in my eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 , a young woman stood up in front of the <unk> and says , as they and their siblings , their parents died in the war .

i want to look back for a look , and see that there &apos;s another girl , a <unk> , <unk> girl on this ted stage .
lg : like , what happened .
licklider realized , computers can do the necessary <unk> to prepare for insight and decisions .
each other interaction is recorded more and more of the other sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer , and it &apos;s a lot of data , and we get a chance to understand our own sense .
this record was human <unk> .
by creating a <unk> process , what else is a job for 40 people over three months , one of the simple things was introduced to three people in 40 hours , and all are the <unk> .
we should stop seeing it .
and for dinner with my wife and children , and drive home .
because people say , &quot; well , man , i don &apos;t have to fit up , you want to be fit .
she was a much bigger dog , when i thought .
these impacts all affect us .
the boom , the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> to our problems .
think about <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina we have more together .
and they &apos;ve probably done this , and if they don &apos;t , they will have to be there .
help me green to make green for the new black , help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive map for my mom .
but i &apos;m skeptical about what that &apos;s like to do .
in this case , you put it in a pile , put it on a pile and the stack of <unk> , the behavior of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case , this case .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn to code .
when kids are creating projects like this , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about that .
and i think that this idea that great cars is a soul , very useful is , you all know . you know , you see a car with the soul , you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite dishes , which is really our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper to provide a studio and six or six or seven homes in malibu <unk> <unk> .

i just have a little lab .
now we &apos;ve got clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that can <unk> us to the market .
100 billion , the only number you need to know .
what you need to think is that we have to do it with a universe , with a hundred billion galaxies , the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was , why the entropy ever was low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to this , we have a good theory that can explain this , if this theory is true , and that the theory of dark energy .
and therefore , although the universe is going to forever continue and ordinary matter and radiation , you can get <unk> , always a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give huge fluctuations .
it cools down .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe you accept and don &apos;t ask .
i never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to go something out to all of those out there , like me , say , the africans and the poor who are struggling with their dreams .
no matter what the movement i made in my real world was just using my little device in digital , and eight years ago , eight years ago , in 2000 .

i &apos;ll give you a quick one .
almost every year we have these terrible <unk> .
we &apos;re in the average of the city in the city .
a city of the future is a city that has no one of the great community that are cities .
the best answer is to try and try to reconstruct a darwinian <unk> architecture , from our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that you &apos;re going to take a kind of attraction to do it , so it &apos;s going to take your joy to look at it just .
and some of them are too big to use them for the butchering .
our strong reaction to images , to look at the expression of emotions in art , to beauty of music before the night sky will have to us and our offspring as long as human beings .
now , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here , like the computer &apos;s the environment , and since you can &apos;t see the flow , we actually <unk> the driver with red leds , so he can actually see what &apos;s going on .
let &apos;s see if it &apos;s actually <unk> .
or the blind people , everyday devices in the household , in education and in office .
a more subtle <unk> had begun . the <unk> , that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and i heard it , it meant something that was wrong with me .
my mental <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , hate , and sexual <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , would be easier to cure , because it &apos;s easier to cure , is easier to cure . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> : if the social change starts , it can &apos;t be more <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to go through right now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that it &apos;s where we &apos;re going to look for life , more than on mars , even though mars is a very much place , and more interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were full of contempt .
because it &apos;s <unk> that the way that life can live there , there has enormous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this highly <unk> of these kinds of creatures and <unk> and naked -- quite <unk> , for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and turned them into things that people use in a new way , and perhaps they would find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s <unk> is that we decided that we decided that all the technology , <unk> , this whole <unk> , and tried to make it as beautiful as possible .
so , we called it y water , so this is another example , where everything is happening in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are developing the brand , it &apos;s all tightly tightly related .
this is my <unk> anthony , in switzerland , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to get it back to back . it was hard .

and if you wonder why the thing is , you need to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s actually shared between the males .

let me give you an example : in the turkey , where i come from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had recently something i was calling to the universities , to <unk> students .

and that &apos;s not right .
this data will send down layer to layer on layer , starting with the base of the product , and put the material layer layer on layer , by which new <unk> flows into a <unk> process , the old layer of <unk> .
it was made by <unk> from layers of about four <unk> .
a snob will be less likely .
they can just make it right to place .
here &apos;s what &apos;s produced .
without any doubt , that technology is going to create a revolution in production and the <unk> as we &apos;re going to change it .
he was worried that if he called it , especially outside , in the public , you could think he would be <unk> in the <unk> of jihad .
they use his <unk> .
the good news is that it &apos;s not to be that way .
but many of these things that played a role , are even more powerful . half of work is done .
i was on with my friend susan <unk> , who was <unk> , in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of all the thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to get the violence or the drugs , the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of the past , the past is going to be able to get to be forgotten , and it was a lot of time .
but it &apos;s less likely that they &apos;re staying .
and during my first year , i was going to go my company .
it &apos;s even said that more energy is needed to make a solar cell than it &apos;s going to make a solar cell in your entire investment .
solar cells harvest , and for four hours , it &apos;s for the second .
and then they &apos;re dangerous with great pressure and so dangerous .
this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder , which is the generator and all the <unk> in it , and this is the hot <unk> , the hot cylinder is the top of the top -- that part will warm off , that &apos;s cold , and it comes to electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a <unk> , that &apos;s energy to use this as fast as we do at the moment .
we pump it up and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab that we put the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i had written bad poems , and he never had the <unk> in the air , but he &apos;s gone to cuba .
so , from <unk> can be a great stuff that comes from -- by which i then get a picture of times , and eventually , it &apos;s going to land in my work .
i work for new yorker , and i &apos;m doing <unk> , and then 9 / 11 , and that was , &quot; um , a <unk> of the world as we knew it .
and then , &quot; let &apos;s clear clearly , &quot; be <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s <unk> with the tongue , but that &apos;s that we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his <unk> had to be extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody comes out on the stairs , and basically -- you know , <unk> seem to be a subject here .
and she &apos;s run with george <unk> , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : so , since my recent childhood , and after that , i had lots of different minds , and when i was young , it always came to me that my path was already <unk> .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should also be on an inner process .
td : lakshmi had been working hard , even for my invitation , let &apos;s leave from everything else that she has done so that , and i was quite a bit like , and i was very nervous about this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned to go in the simulation of the simulation , and others who actually learned it .
when i say , &quot; i &quot; i mean , i &apos;m going to <unk> the advice .
but no one thinks it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the spending in the state of the veteran is the <unk> of the <unk> of bush , and the threat of <unk> <unk> .
we know that the virus is being fixed . it &apos;s going to be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a <unk> debate about what percentage of the <unk> between humans and coughing on and <unk> and what happens about the hands .
some of the poorer countries that have experience with h5n1 , <unk> , camps , who are already being up .
and i think our leaders would say that we have yet to have a lot to do that .
i &apos;m very excited to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have one of them developed one of them -- as fast <unk> .
and in the past , in humans , people were similar bacterial infections also don &apos;t have a problem .
don &apos;t pay attention to how much fun you have with it , but how the <unk> <unk> completely changed the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please put me a <unk> .
i <unk> myself with a young tribe from a force , and he <unk> a way to sell three clubs .
i &apos;ve been playing with <unk> and climbing , which is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
manhattan is not going to go into an infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i &apos;m going to stay in the middle .
she was one , pushed me to the triumph .
because of the <unk> leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark and very quietly .
i and my colleagues are interested in the dynamics of the <unk> that live in the woods .
we &apos;re advising with the media about <unk> ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then the students in our <unk> came up and they &apos;ve got their own <unk> with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow up to grow a frog <unk> <unk> , which is a high species of basking oil fields in the states and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you &apos;ve hidden in front of you . &quot;
so , we see a rising demand demand , and so therefore , therefore we &apos;re looking for demand .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and i learned two really important things that day .
the deeper we go underwater , the higher the pressure is .
so i started to get this up about 15 years ago .
the <unk> , the air goes into the <unk> , <unk> out the air .
so each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are there , there are reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat extends on a lot of miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people are .
when we found him , we weren &apos;t even sure what family he belongs , so we called him <unk> , and he looked like this , he was coming from one of his books .
the oxygen caused a <unk> and it <unk> .
this means that every one , and every one of you here is at least a child , that &apos;s a <unk> .
and his communication and social interaction , so <unk> , he could visit a normal school and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s such a bit like life : if you &apos;re just in it , you can &apos;t get out .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but remember that day , one day will be told you , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we , all of us , are what happens when a <unk> from hydrogen and helium is so long to make it to ask yourself about the origins of the origins .
and these <unk> evidence that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to have to take the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step to appreciate itself with life elsewhere in the world .
so it &apos;s going to be so important as though , and we &apos;re going to expand the future by looking at 350 grains , so it &apos;s sensitive to the moore &apos;s law , the increased computing of computing .
and then we would like to improve the <unk> search for human <unk> .
and many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to investigate the development of climate change .
each cylinder is a <unk> of time .
as you <unk> with the ice , you put a extra pair of gloves in a oven so that you can put a new pair of gloves , if your <unk> and your fingers are stiff .
i think this is a little bit of <unk> , if you put a little bit of <unk> .
and our soldier are not very happily to judge the pipelines in <unk> mines , when they actually have to be used to their own , to <unk> american <unk> .
you can even further further , and the efficiency of a big <unk> improvement , and it &apos;s almost triple the margin of the great <unk> .
we could build a bigger car that would make safety , but easy to be .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we &apos;ve got to <unk> our <unk> and the other ones .
and it &apos;s by making the <unk> mass of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to make <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> , the <unk> can do that , as it has gone to the <unk> of the internet .
it can &apos;t just act to act a huge <unk> conspiracy .
there were two kinds of negative feedbacks that we have received .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really robust .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
in the end , he found a <unk> , a dutch <unk> named &quot; <unk> , van meegeren , who sold a wonderful vermeer &apos;s worth of a price , which today is about 10 million dollars .
according to his <unk> , he saw his <unk> , &quot; if he had discovered the first time that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming to it . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find them how much she is sexually or romantic , depends on what you think of who you consider .
but each one of these three objects has value to a value beyond what it takes , because of its story .
but i don &apos;t want to copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he took joshua bell to take his <unk> into a subway station in washington d.c. , to put himself in a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock hurts less because you &apos;re a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see that there may be a kind of political <unk> .
and they <unk> that they &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> member of the <unk> , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , that people who eat vegetables and olive olive oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most fascinating things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> , if you give a drug in a such high dose of all the side effects , and your new drug is going to look better .
the great attempts are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that &apos;s currently not solving any solution .
and very soon they would have begun to <unk> these charcoal , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , back to china and everywhere .
can you imagine how you feel , if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all of you know .
there &apos;s this thing , the <unk> of the world , and it &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they are christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they &apos;re happy . this is wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all the other are chinese .
can imagine that maybe one of them will be down to his kid and she hugging and she said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back to be back .
everything has changed .
and all of this has had tremendous implications to the world .
i think thomas jefferson has really really got really good in words .
so for the <unk> in the audience , you can &apos;t explain why <unk> is a greater budget than <unk> , which is that <unk> <unk> have a greater <unk> in other languages and culture , and so the market for those films are bigger .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the <unk> of the united states that &apos;s going to be about a million people , but the gdp per capita -- 200,000 dollars per capita .
also , as everybody here knows -- it &apos;s energy , not oil .
my choice is a life of a life that &apos;s started to grow up on the gulf coast on the gulf coast on the gulf coast .
a lot of our actions on this planet that are affecting our living environment are just by thinking and a <unk> .
one is for thousands or millions of years .
we need to calm ourselves before we go the planet .
e.o. wilson : salvation on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the genome of passenger pigeon 1.3 billion pairs .
the reversal of de-extinction is falling into this category .
real falcon , slightly <unk> chicken .
there &apos;s a program that &apos;s been a program for <unk> that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional subject . some people get up .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
i also made my own comic book , which was another way to tell stories , through words and through pictures .
and we sat down there , and he said to me , &quot; you really adore . &quot;
use your own style . draw how you say it .
&quot; happy stupid , i &apos;ve got your <unk> .
i &apos;m also going to put a book of book called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> : the <unk> who are <unk> who are <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us constantly , psychologically , is <unk> and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds of food , and it &apos;s been built by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids that are affected by .
people who say , don &apos;t have the team to be in this team because the noise may like , and need the rest of the rest .
&quot; upwake &quot; a story about zero , a vibrant man , who &apos;s life in the suitcase room , and the <unk> and reality is <unk> and not in the position to <unk> both .
<unk> <unk> and four and four and a half years later , what began as a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> talented .
i know theater is connecting us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talent to create a smart , important and remarkable work . and <unk> .
if you look around the bathroom , you see some more products like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also , also .
<unk> collagen -- or since the 1970s , collagen of pigs -- is used to inject it in fold .
and in fact , i found <unk> products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid , you &apos;ve got a long and a <unk> year before you . &quot;
i told them , i should tell you this , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
and they gave me the feeling of somebody , to be somebody in a time i was like a no one .
they &apos;re working on the ninth / issue , so they &apos;ve been around a 1930s and now reached the letters of the same .
hundreds of verbs are so concerned .
you can see that as the language of mind , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why is , you know , <unk> and <unk> are so often covered ?
you can try to imagine what might be like if language is only literally used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem .
here &apos;s my argument . is it <unk> ? is it good ?
this makes it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what &apos;s the insight from that won that you have to convince me ?
all of these different roles , can you imagine an argument where they &apos;re involved , but also in the audience and watch the debate ?
or -- and this is the most important part for me : we want them to go into the world of nature . we bring a <unk> and find the masters of the adaptation in nature that could inspire us .
that changed everything . from there , these engineers don &apos;t go into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the <unk> national lab .
that would be <unk> for fuel cells if you could get <unk> .
it &apos;s not easy , because life is just a subset of the elements in the <unk> .
feeling and reacting : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is not counting .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia are almost half of a million companies .
because , as i think , smaller <unk> in direct levels of <unk> are <unk> .
and the world in all the world are not exceptions .
people predicted that this <unk> and the wonder .
i have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> cows on my <unk> , and i want to use a paper towel to make it <unk> .
first we did .
what does that mean ?
when i started to talk to you , i realized that they were incredibly adept adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
and finally , until they were doing their degree and they went out and <unk> -- and certainly happy to come there -- and i &apos;m sure there was gone back to the time , and found that crows always remembered .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they &apos;re teaching each other things .
i would come back to you , for example , go for the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three mysteries i could not solve , and i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what happened , because every region has something to offer .
let me make the connection .
you know , there &apos;s the <unk> of the future . you have to understand this .
this is a lot to <unk> .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of the sound .
they &apos;re about 10 million prescriptions each .
and over here , we see , with the words of the radiologists israel , israel , &quot; like the hand of israel and wise , which reminds itself . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yeah , but i would rather just eat if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should an experiment .
he had a line of the book that was supposed to be from the <unk> , and there was a <unk> maria <unk> , who had trouble with the outlook .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read them what she said , because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i had to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our history .
now i would have thought to this moment that the age of 50 , one of the skills i really got really , was to bind my shoes .
first of all , i have to say i &apos;m not from here .
yeah . the artist seems to be not so right where it &apos;s supposed to be <unk> by the different colors .
but i can see in their faces that they &apos;re still a bit of <unk> .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i was having fun to have fun , and before i left the room , i was just hanging around the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
my dad was one , my youth was so interesting .
the song as a mere fact .
i &apos;m sorry , &quot; wait a minute , i &apos;m going to do the wheels . &quot; from <unk> , i bought the wheels , and i built them up and -- look at it , and i could ask you , could i have my <unk> ?
it just sounds simple , but i think we &apos;re in general , and culture with <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> himself , and he was really proud of that .
man , i love this thing .
the consequences of a planet , on which already seven billion people live .
and especially proud of the <unk> , he was really <unk> , the real <unk> he had had had had had his <unk> and on the beautiful <unk> around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- aware of the original thing to do better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left <unk> and i <unk> that she was lost , <unk> all the way that i hadn &apos;t done yet , but no longer was possible .
and then i started as many times before , questions like my life was different , if that man didn &apos;t hurt me if my genes had to have a different part of experience .
i was , but i was now despite a <unk> myself , and that , i guess , i was going to be myself .
i had a lot simpler , <unk> : this <unk> <unk> to four words and to make me back to my journey .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for decade .
yeah , contrast .
we work with the machine <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego combined .
first , the perceptions of people , and two , a natural interface , a natural form of the control , so that the interaction with the robot is more intuitive .
and yet , i made this idea to her .
after i recognized this economic problem , i thought we need to find a solution to this problem .
some of even people have <unk> the speakers in the way to speak to nathan <unk> , or the one of tim ferriss that might be considered as a result .
i know no tedtalk that includes that .
this time i paid 25 cents because i found the job was a little harder job .
and yet , there was one thing that everybody was being secure : that &apos;s going to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the back , because i &apos;m going to call them three <unk> now string theory .
the <unk> went on to about 10 to 10 .
and he was working decades to explain this number , but he had no success , and we know why .
each of these universes have the extra dimensions .
because the astronomers from today , to turn into mighty telescopes to the sky , you find a handful of <unk> photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , billions years .
now , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to get you and really get more excited about .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> . &quot;
pm : so this is dimitri &apos;s so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anyone here .
the next moment the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the television is , arms men are on the street there .
it was a very grim meeting meeting the reporters who worked in the war , the employees of aid agencies , and of course the <unk> , brave people of sarajevo .
if i &apos;m asked , why do i make more <unk> , why i &apos;m going to stay with , that &apos;s why .
but it &apos;s my job of this statement , and this is the <unk> , the core of the thing , for us , &quot; reporter .
even before a goal appears to find the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and find the goal of what it is .
we basically <unk> the animals so they were able to control and explore the <unk> and objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment that we did some years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju made the <unk> .
please raise your hand .
the last reason that women have to do with that , that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , in the suburbs , in average , one of seven women were born of a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he was watching as a <unk> <unk> , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment in the training of girls in the developing world is going to be the highest <unk> . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole vertebrae is a single story that tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this picture makes the suspects of the <unk> being brought to be <unk> -- like something of the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of the ways that we could have to be able to do in small <unk> could be able to recover .
they put their arrowheads down and say , &quot; i want to add this guy down to the finished arrows , and we &apos;re going to share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island , where they can make a new language or four kilometers into a new language .
when 27 individuals out of this 27 century , they put on a table , their 23 languages , they will just say , a simple calculation that you will need to have a army of <unk> <unk> to be prepared for all the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they had language .
and what interests me most is , is the invisible space between a text and the other picture , and how the image is changing through the text and the text through the image .
this is <unk> <unk> , which are connecting to the bottom of the atlantic ocean and north america .
they turn the negative to do .
but through the impression of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> was eight years of a <unk> <unk> , in arizona , for kidnapping and <unk> boys on a <unk> .
they are leaving themselves .
and they have taken us to texas for us .
and now drive with the <unk> where you &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the length of the space that makes it look like this wouldn &apos;t happen .
something called a <unk> for a sense : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in part , it &apos;s a heritage called <unk> , the <unk> , the pursuit of happiness for <unk> , it &apos;s been found by <unk> aspects of the individual and cannot be found in reality .
a <unk> in science of happiness is that happiness and adversity is no <unk> in a closed-loop way .
it starts in <unk> <unk> .
this is a three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only a way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to conclude with some of the quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has the rat , we make a little bit of the job .
you can actually heal people , even in people who are hiv positive .
and knowing that a patient who has the <unk> to <unk> up to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be sure that we &apos;ve saved many lives .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question : if i just watch another person being touched , why am i not confused and i literally put this <unk> off the <unk> , like someone else ?
thank you . i have two missions here .
i don &apos;t really go to the <unk> , but it &apos;s about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> by the way , by the <unk> of kew , by the <unk> .
even each single one of us has a story of a story of the <unk> on us .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to tackle this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we saw women and death and death through heart disease , they wrote an op-ed for new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women , whose <unk> of the lens , the heart of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women , that &apos;s the test that we need to do it , that &apos;s the test ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they did what they said they were given and they were <unk> .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish , they don &apos;t feel like that .
what does that mean for us ?
over three years , we took a daily basis to 10 hours , and raised about a <unk> hours of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> , which is something that was really surprised to us .
and finally , my son alone is going to be in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project , philip <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy are here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamics in the game .
this is the first time that our son took more than two steps on once , on a row , photographed in the movie .
and this is an important to <unk> question , because the better we understand how the brain meaning , the better we can communicate , and i think we can think and work together .
it &apos;s a kind of a center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the kind of time . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is our teams , our teams , <unk> the entire <unk> of a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just hygiene , but it &apos;s also about hygiene , but it &apos;s also about being <unk> .
so , you don &apos;t build it .
if you translate into the building industry , if you have a <unk> and a window , you say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s got to be fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we continued to put forward .
are we just dumb ?
you can <unk> back in two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so you can <unk> and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why do you not do that ? &quot;
and the police are waiting for the <unk> to cut the car into chunks , to get the body &apos;s body .
and that &apos;s enough to the present to the <unk> in the united states , which is a view of the divine <unk> .
all of this leads to us -- <unk> , just to name the time : what we do most is to use digital devices .
that &apos;s the implication of destruction from more than one third of the brain on the right side of the brain .
this is a very , very low level to be discharged from the health system .
he gave my jaw in the right position as he <unk> my teeth .
and the <unk> is a brilliant physicist and an innovator that fascinated with a fascinating , in the consciousness , whether he &apos;s a deaf hearing , or a blind that &apos;s going to see , or a paralyzed that movement .
now i had to find out in the dark years , the followed , find out what was happening today , it was gone .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , you &apos;re time with simon .
and these were developing countries , they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a great <unk> of africa and the one that &apos;s on this side .
and then deng xiaoping and brought money to china and put the country back into a middle way .
a search function , which we can copy the data into a <unk> format and then we can publish the world , and what do we hear if we look around ?
but this creates some hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explains the life after it was born , what was the essence of life ?
and there i learned francis crick .
but there was what the literature was .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girl was not married .
you can actually compare to the way you can compare to these regular branches and <unk> segments .
and so i close by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , the defense is about two million dollars and takes 18 months when they gain .
first , they don &apos;t fight the patent , but against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll let them go with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; &quot; the girls &quot;
the fathers were in a place where they could take their daughters to play , their chairs and their hand could kill their own dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
and the enemy cannot see most of the time , and so they needed a different approach to eradicate polio when we were able to eradicate smallpox .
it helped have helped to control pandemic pandemic viruses , sars .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now , &quot; where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio
dj : so we found this <unk> now in all kinds of animals , especially with the cats .
and our surprise was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol for inspiration , a symbol of that hope that &apos;s accompanied us at our work .
it was incredibly amazing when it took into safety to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> , the <unk> , reminds me of a very eerie sense , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other than man and woman , as a community and as part of this planet and we have to go on .
after all , it seems obvious to be that the earth is big and <unk> , the sun is small and flexible , but it &apos;s worth remembering what <unk> would be .
and that &apos;s because there &apos;s always a middle of the astronomy .
the nature of this model depends on the ground that we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because there isn &apos;t any consensus on their <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , so as we see it in middle world , <unk> and solid .
people are actually <unk> as a machine , and it &apos;s a <unk> time , but it &apos;s a <unk> time , if you can guess what the job of being next is going to do next .
and night , i was going to <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> at the ripe age 40 .
and then , over a <unk> i can use my head , allow me to get these <unk> , videos of robot , to try and push the buttons in a <unk> .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream .
in oceanography , a <unk> health agency is developed by the <unk> of the <unk> that are sending out the dolphins , visualizing .
i think together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s now some of the things that you can learn from it .
but we don &apos;t usually do that .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
now , this is down to 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also suppose most of you don &apos;t speak chinese , which is really sad , if you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what are you looking at ? maybe we should .
and if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why should i care ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and find the world and find its place in it .
they would overcome wealth and security , religious violence and make sure that states will never be <unk> <unk> .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war was 20 million people living in life -- until today , the world &apos;s <unk> civil war .
<unk> sen , who &apos;s this guy : &quot; i would have made all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all of these time to go to the american man who had stolen my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant , and it &apos;s not being centralized .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken that started in fact in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was working at the university in new york city , in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th , the 18th century is actually looking for medicine to <unk> medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would really have a really big seller .
when the <unk> started , i was actually becoming less , i was always <unk> , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
remember , remember , as a child , to get to a line ?
at 18 and 19 , i ran through the night .
every time i &apos;m going to get a little depressed and <unk> .
so many of us , we know , there &apos;s a lot of going to be doing a lot of things to do , and to do a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world working with the familiar with the familiar problems that emerged from the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you add the impossible , you do it .
but we &apos;ve reached an agreement to climate change .
and there was crying .
the <unk> power is a remarkable remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their <unk> to create a material that is extremely hard to the <unk> of technical fibers like kevlar .
or you have nice things like this , if the camera can capture this .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from the tissue .
with my new project , tidying up , i want to use art to make technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to have the same thing and the round of the <unk> and the <unk> -- hopefully it &apos;s to help him make some of the next choices .
what do i do ? &quot;
the other day , heather , <unk> data , a <unk> that can much more than <unk> <unk> -- he can collect the feedback of his audience , and the way his behavior is the answers to the crowd . does this thing ?
stanley mcchrystal , inventor the known &quot; <unk> &quot; of <unk> , &quot; <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> , that there were two people to connect a connection to five to seven steps .
how does our view of relations with <unk> groups ?
however , there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have given me that same thing .
&quot; um , my dad , a <unk> ?
his father who decided they took false papers .
this feeling of responsibility about others , he had another <unk> of the lives of the lives of 17 , and his fault , to be a <unk> , because he had stayed out of a camp , while his friends had stayed , kept him alive .
and while my <unk> and my <unk> gave up my <unk> , i was <unk> , i was terrified my father false papers .
i asked him , given the victims he had to do it , he had the ever ever ever scratched .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> level , which seems to be a <unk> after the next <unk> , which seems to be a good state .
if you go into the forests , the border , the border , you &apos;re going to <unk> the ability to stay stable .
with the knowledge of <unk> , fishermen , the <unk> great barrier reef <unk> and scientists , that the great barrier reef reef is under the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , that is clear that the <unk> change is not an option .
and that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today , because i really like media all .
this is a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
first , he uses an ancient way of manufacturing , and connected to a three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technology to this time .
and through the process of sugar on black <unk> , i made portraits portraits .
it became very big pictures , and i took them with a very big camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially at worse , is enough to go .
back in the back , a sequence also has .
we can ask : there are general differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of today &apos;s living people .
so we can then mixed with those differences in the same questions , like neanderthal : did you find the same thing for the <unk> , like neanderthal : have you mixed with ancestors today ?
there are lots of people who made their own vision of their own vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> growing in the 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in a <unk> embedded in a <unk> embedded , and the forces that occur in their components .
they don &apos;t talk . but they were very isolated from the world around them , from their surroundings and from the people .
they would call the police . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about 100 100 .
you see a video .
and you feel that the research that you have to do with , really , really , really , really , can actually prevent the effect that you can actually prevent this experience , which i &apos;ve begun to do my journey on this field .
then you pick up .
<unk> <unk> you put yourself in a rigid position -- and his chin is <unk> on the <unk> , arms extended <unk> on your <unk> .
they made everything just as we were taught them .
and after battle , they bring these mobile to the lecture and do what you call &quot; <unk> &quot; to teach you what you did wrong .
and people have changed .
i said , &quot; where &apos;s he now ? &quot;
this is not a piece of cake .
and she pointed out on the left to say , as a problem of this picture , it was a <unk> for you with the idea of <unk> .
it &apos;s really in this sense of <unk> , that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m going to ask .
now , this is sort of an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how shall we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to make numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you have to do this , before you decided you didn &apos;t have anything ? &quot;
their <unk> increased on 50 , which would be <unk> schools , and they would have to do with a <unk> biotechnology .
it was 76 percent . when the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted , he was going to be <unk> da vinci .
these are stills .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness , on the <unk> side of the location of a <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
if i had to reduce the entire story , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some snippets from my other big project in this year , &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm storm -- the tempest .
and our little life ends in a sleeping .
bono : they are <unk> .
i know you understand this .
so , blue , it was blue ; everything was being blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them are playing in africa .
it &apos;s another one that &apos;s acting on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> that we have , and find out what price people pay for it , so they would have the choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was that if my mom couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroy two <unk> and 10 tv .
and the little <unk> <unk> to take out of its trace , and that was a problem .
this is pretty good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models i work with .
tissue of <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that will actually be the key to use these models for self-reflection .
thank you .
and the attempt to let them fly straight , like the attempt to shoot the arrow , and it was hard work , and boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more inclusive , as <unk> , as <unk> -- with darpa , the <unk> institute of technology and university of los angeles .
be careful , just behave like wood , or something like that .
now i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they go on forever .
that &apos;s about two billion .
it takes him to be about &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget about the one day .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time we live in the human mind and machines can gain .
i have a very clear mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s to fear that the way in the wild was going to be extinct in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence of the bottom is that this cancer is transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity to take it , and took some samples from jonas &apos; tumor and some samples from other parts .
she took him to the veterinarian and this discovered something <unk> .
ultimately , the cancer is a <unk> of the ability to share and adapt to your environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomena .
they would be <unk> to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason , why a low expectation is not happy to us .
but they didn &apos;t seem to do that the numbers on their <unk> .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the optimism bias for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not break , if we &apos;re going to be aware of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;re seeing in the 21st century is asia , which is gradually coming back to conflict and to do more than half the world &apos;s population and to do the half of the global performance .
you could look at this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after 1958 , the soviets sputnik had <unk> , it was like , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi , or <unk> , your view of china &apos;s ascent to be something different than if you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to bring this into greater historical context , we will be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> , so it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> .
so this is the conventional approach .
this has actually <unk> responsibility to <unk> the responsibility to guarantee a stable vaccine company .
they depend on each other .
jobs for whom ? especially for young men .
after the age of the system , after the system , you can &apos;t get the real estate .
the supply of the power of your own , after the conflict , the conflict , would be provided .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has realized . it &apos;s called climate change , which is secure and stability , whereas governments in the world are discussing , as to react .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford to do with the time you can do it .
these are inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel capable of planning for a <unk> world .
listen like chinese students &apos; s by injecting english by throwing it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and this includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , abstractions that we &apos;re trying to make sense of <unk> , and we take the hypothetical seriously , that means we &apos;re more likely to be more likely to be what &apos;s what is .
luria saw people before they were in the scientific age of <unk> , and he found that these people were resistant to a taxonomy of the concrete world .
and then , there said , &quot; the north is always snow .
they chose <unk> rather than new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you deserve it to be killed ? &quot;
you could say , a circle .
it feels like i was staying in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they <unk> me to do something like anything .
it &apos;s still in red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifices , this film <unk> .
i &apos;m one of her favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : the <unk> is serious .
we were all mad at them , &quot; why are you doing this ?
it &apos;s going to be much more powerful if you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve been playing the game after school , for weeks , about seven weeks , and we basically had all <unk> <unk> crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people answered good patients and <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like its own little fusing .
if i all <unk> the three legs of it , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> proposition -- this old <unk> and this old plastic , that <unk> goes into an old <unk> .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or in a state school -- a leaf , a ruler and a pen , no glue .
what we do is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little straw , which you do is these two corners of this <unk> , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
these are two magnets .
there were lots of passengers on the ship , and they were boring , so the captain they &apos;re going to be on his deck .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> <unk> demonstrates very simple and <unk> plans to transform waste into really <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that many of the evidence were provided .
and there are some examples of projects that are really aware of trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little bit , we can <unk> a space of traffic , which is going to turn into a turn to the open room for people who are growing up with food and waste into increased <unk> circuits .
this photograph was done on the day of it , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you go water water , the first thing is <unk> , the <unk> .
no , you have to explore the people of the world with visions of visions . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the actual real thing was that there were lots of men who wanted to take out of me .
very few of us have the ability to be totally honest with themselves .
he &apos;d like to travel while it &apos;s not on a <unk> .
i was trying to be the <unk> .
because they remember my <unk> : they need to reach a <unk> of 700 points and nobody did .
most of you , <unk> are the average , not eight years old , not eight years old , and if we look at the <unk> &apos; s , the <unk> of tomorrow &apos;s older adults .
imagine that you &apos;re very , very good .
these <unk> have a lot of other benefits of attention and a sense of attention that is also increasing , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this outcome , and it &apos;s in the context of a different group of <unk> , a group that is actually very looking at our society , which is to run the <unk> in our society .
so let me step through this process , with a task that is a mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just get all the different kinds of different things that we see , walking , walking .
so it was a big , very complex project , which i couldn &apos;t even have to do it , whether it works at all .
so , wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on the one hand , we &apos;ve mathematica , with the kind of more <unk> language , <unk> language and a huge network of <unk> , capable of doing a lot of the <unk> just a few lines .
so with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to go to go to the world and realize that certain materials make sense of specific technological purpose and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited to the discovery that there are <unk> universes with incredibly simple rules that have special relativity theory that special theory of relativity , and gravity and at least evidence of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i lost more relatives , and teachers who <unk> me , hiv / aids .
they jump . they wear red clothes .
because my mom was a woman , she had no right to land , and automatically owned a pretty much , and automatically had a right to know , and my dad , anyway , my father , so he had right .
and the day before the actual trial , we were excited , and they didn &apos;t slept all night .
he was wearing sneakers , and this was not even <unk> , and it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and do anything that you would ask for that .
if it was pregnant , the mother was made in charge and punished .
as we speak , you will never get to get a girl in a <unk> .
consumers , the 72 percent of american gdp , are actually beginning to be <unk> , their <unk> , <unk> , their <unk> , <unk> , to liberate their lives , in everyday life , to liberate the risk of taking risks that we &apos;re moving forward .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually <unk> and basically , in principle , future children of our homes .
<unk> are at 48 percent , which is the cornell of the institute .
we &apos;re also seeing a trend in a <unk> tourism . right ?
one is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and the more entrenched of the neighbor &apos;s ears as support .
we also observe a big <unk> .
the trend with the <unk> is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got the question , i &apos;m the only one that &apos;s going to do ?
you could exploit them .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing in my life -- stories , novels , writing , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some of the regrets , the <unk> creatures .
our <unk> could be <unk> , our hearts might be stunted , and our <unk> may be <unk> if we &apos;re going to live in a long time in our cultural lives .
i came across the first time that i call it , &quot; miscellaneous battles . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no <unk> or <unk> , i &apos;m going to ask why i do this . but this is the commute between languages , it enables me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see an manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story was to a big deal , because i was prosecuted .
literature has to lead to the other side .
i could have a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that will be a happy story , and in my next book i might write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to get the <unk> , you fold it into small bits , and you fill it back together , mix them together and so you get a new print , but this new song is clear from old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are more likely to be <unk> compared to the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to sum up what it said . <unk> <unk> : the <unk> of the telephone , by putting a symbol with his fingers .
our creativity comes from the outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see it , because then you have your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb there , a kind of <unk> <unk> , almost like to put out of the limb .
our exploration of solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
so this led to a grasp of nuclear structure , because it &apos;s so <unk> that atoms have a single nucleus , with <unk> who circle it .
this image shows a galaxy , a <unk> , with , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can ultimately be the most important ideas for us , about the place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
this is here . this is at home . we &apos;re here .
and with each click and every touch of the screen , we let the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information everywhere , all of our way through the digital woods .
when our daughter sat down to the <unk> , i asked her , &quot; will you put a lot of a lot of emphasis on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do this with a <unk> .
now , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much so and i talked about , i decided to my last birthday , that i couldn &apos;t speak more , a day -- a day .
and you don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained to a friend who my sign of mind was that i was going through my life , that i was not talking about it , that i was not talking about this , and that &apos;s the last time somebody would translate my sign language .
well , i &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> .
i started talking to speak , because i had studied <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was going to just start to use my mind , but never about my decision to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried that i would be going back and forth again .
i felt so powerless because i had to eat so much , but my father had died of hunger .
but i realize that your gesture of love and care is also affecting lives of another joseph , and to change thousands of other <unk> that still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials , but this was much more intense than i had to make and make easy easy to make new materials and make it easy to make a <unk> <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my career as an architect because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , government , developer .
and then the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake earthquake in japan .
so i wonder what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we are born , even in the womb .
so fetuses are learning to the particular language that &apos;s been talking about in the world that they &apos;re born .
it creates a mixture of the kind of place that relates to this and peculiar , as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition exist in the womb ?
you can see <unk> , but you can see it also with other eyes .
this is a trust that is essential to any kind of <unk> system .
the audience will be <unk> on <unk> <unk> , which is very logical , but not with the resemblance to what &apos;s going on in front of their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it might even be smiling .
you might remember that as the <unk> , okay , back in the world at the greatest deal of all .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the world , and somebody tells you , &quot; what does it mean for the eliminating of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
and this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that strategy plays a role .
for me , was all the music .
now , if i use my software software , the camera is the <unk> , and it &apos;s the point of the <unk> in relation to the <unk> , and you have a whiteboard .
i remember that the poor had to take some <unk> -- eating , clothing , shelter -- whatever they didn &apos;t .
i even felt a <unk> from shame .
now , since i heard it , i was excited for various reasons .
i was not even asked to ask a donation that was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the world &apos;s history of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving us a way to get what their dignity would say , a partnership doesn &apos;t mean , which is based on a traditional way of a donation , crazy that is what their dignity can happen .
it &apos;s a very far <unk> combination , a very strong combination .
now , the moment is still , in the beginning , and it &apos;s <unk> for me , it &apos;s very clear that it &apos;s just vehicle , just a tool .
what &apos;s the future of humanity ?
now , i turn to the second big question : are we alone , or are there life in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions , we &apos;ve been doing remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate is doubling even for 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> , that &apos;s the most sacred law .
but what about them ? what &apos;s going to do with you ?
they sail the sail in their bio and occasionally take them to the experiments that their parents would not agree with .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
previous generations , these experiments couldn &apos;t do at all .
and i found that the first technology of <unk> million years ago was <unk> <unk> .
we can learn a lot of learning about it .
and i see <unk> from and trying to protect my child in this way , because with a kid you don &apos;t just let anyone do it even the minister .
and secondly , they say that they had a <unk> gang , but some of the <unk> for the climb trees .
and then we &apos;ve got our knowledge about our ancestors , in principle , adult individuals , because the fossils , the <unk> , missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> explores the origins of humankind in the vast ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a <unk> child and what we can learn about our humanity .
and if everybody should be the rules , of course , you need to have an effective system to design and <unk> because , as we &apos;ve found , is , in everything , is necessary to control .
it &apos;s seen as high seas , because the continent of <unk> <unk> has been covered .
we need to work locally , but also <unk> <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
and <unk> <unk> says , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
that was probably a good idea .
to get to clear to say , i &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
finally , i think we need to think about whether we want to be our reality -- and if , what &apos;s going to be for our idea of life and for everything that comes out afterwards .
it looks like it &apos;s crude oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and <unk> , the right solution to have the right solution , however hard that is the problem .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and explaining how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than americans , for example , higher than americans .
we &apos;ll try and try and get it wrong .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , trying to try it again , but he couldn &apos;t prove the presumption .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not ignorance .
china wants to have achieved this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even do slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s ugly , and it &apos;s happening soon , and it &apos;s soon going to be ugly -- with certainty in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re able to overcome it all the way that we &apos;re headed to .
and here you come into play .
and what we need to think is this is , if you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can make this debt up to our children , but imagine that we can make up to you .
everything else is <unk> .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
students would know what stage is the cell development .
that should be no amazing thing or ?
all we have got is <unk> .
you &apos;ll be able to focus your listening to the sensitivity , or <unk> can be a series of things that we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not a decade of years .
we should say these cheap , simple <unk> , and nobody can &apos;t use them to use for their kids . &quot;
and here we can see this .
we cannot be risking the trust of customers .
it &apos;s got only 500 and you could have to get 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge array of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we all talk about -- is <unk> a little less than 5,000 days .
of course , there &apos;s been about 5,000 days -- the web , but only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to do is a <unk> , a human brain when we look at the rate , which is growing , and then there are six billion years of <unk> .
now it &apos;s not that -- if you make a table and things at work , a word , they &apos;re not part of the web , but they &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the extended senses of the machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want it .
the last point i wanted to talk about was the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
third , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous than that is going to fill our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i convinced the second <unk> of jesus christ had happened that there was the sun moon , and that i was ready to be a <unk> and ready to become his <unk> .
these are the dead ones of <unk> .
and it &apos;s making everything . it makes it logically .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we &apos;re grabbing things .
this is a project that we just completed in <unk> for a major <unk> , which is just the result of a variety of forces that are going to evolve .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude , because the lack of the more interesting is .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are actually teaching young people .
and finally , to end one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of you is going to be a neighbor &apos;s neighbor .
so , as we have to pay for school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may be surprised , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this is a very , very important thing to do , is it can be <unk> .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , flavor and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , at some point , we were all like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who are going to name 250,000 stars in the night sky .
of course , the <unk> monks have said .
the <unk> , the post , to the sun , is actually a <unk> that reflects constantly reflected the light that reflects on the sacred <unk> of machu picchu , <unk> <unk> .
if you ask for the dead , you do with the hands of those gestures you &apos;re going to go up and forth in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother had the <unk> in the world , the mountains of the hills have created the mountains and the home that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material you all know about is <unk> , but i &apos;m more likely to think about the toxic white stuff .
i &apos;m going to pick up there , you fit in there , because in a hundred years , my body can return back without heart disease .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world and not to take care of <unk> or <unk> , because you &apos;ve got many alternatives .
first , they start putting atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve started a competition four years ago called &quot; your naked <unk> . &quot;
my country is in a <unk> of debt .
and that &apos;s -- -- this is still a lot more <unk> than all the speakers are going to come to me and all those who come to me .
and they thought about my work of mathematical models that should promote an understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience likes to do <unk> -- from deep , cultural reasons , they think they &apos;re boring for boring -- and find a different pattern of more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways to think about two ways .
if you toss a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
and then to more <unk> , they &apos;re going to <unk> because of uncertainty .
and only one percent of them .
he <unk> : &quot; i suppose that a sudden death of death in a family will remain the chance for another equal . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but it &apos;s pretty unlikely .
the quality of the quality of the quality of the <unk> effects is carried by statistics .
the <unk> <unk> has saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the world .
a clever receptacle is being recognized because the power is that the power is recognized , and it &apos;s just going to be recognized by the way that it &apos;s recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . it &apos;s a term <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;ve facebook , we have <unk> .
but nevertheless , the <unk> itself can create a very strong force , which has never happened in history .
so , in fact , chinese chinese are looking at the <unk> , not just as merely as merely .
how big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , through <unk> , they &apos;ve been really transformed , they made more and more transparent because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
increasingly , more chinese can see the free of speech and human rights than their <unk> counterparts , instead of a <unk> privilege .
many of you know that beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony was symphony .
i &apos;m not saying that they don &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister &apos;s pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like its <unk> was taken to try and the one that &apos;s been <unk> out there and his skull on the sides of the mountain .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m <unk> , in this <unk> audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , this is another thing .
and in this momentous point in the dutch story , my father was on the shore of the <unk> river in the edges of the river river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression , since the end of the cold war , since the end of the cold war .

this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the middle of the yosemite .
you can &apos;t let &quot; let &apos;s say &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in the very very well .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology evolves in a <unk> fashion .
now , evolution took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of that interaction , the evolution using evolution in basically the technology , the next stage , to produce the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can also exploit well the third dimension .
over the last 50 years we had 28 percent of <unk> growth in the <unk> .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
to take our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing is to be about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to be able to reach the full <unk> of these trends , and they have to be able to understand how often the sensitivity turned on in the form of technology -- faster and faster if we get to that point .
you can <unk> and <unk> with .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , you know , there &apos;s nothing here .
dopamine is obviously the stuff that &apos;s related to <unk> .
and we call this a schizophrenia .
and he was so <unk> to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought of thought , they &apos;re a <unk> in the african plain .
september 11th has a <unk> . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own <unk> product , and we have a <unk> product .
i wasn &apos;t as good as he , but we managed to get <unk> n and <unk> , tracy and bruce <unk> to an <unk> for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
they used to say , &quot; let &apos;s say the truth &quot; and we &apos;re going to get forward .
musician and activist peter gabriel discusses personal motivation , with the <unk> <unk> of human rights and shares stories of active <unk> .
next , we asked how to do it ?
he recognizes the problem and it &apos;s knowing with it . the dance is his <unk> that allows him to orient .
the beetles can climb much less likely to get a little less less than if they don &apos;t carry on a little bit like they don &apos;t .
this is our <unk> experimenter .
let &apos;s play a <unk> and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to fall into these big adventures , is not quite a bit of my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s going to make a <unk> in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of the presentation is that they are the entrepreneurs to invest in and invest in and make a lot of money .
and the experience of making a company or to do something -- that must not be a company .
there &apos;s no <unk> , <unk> , where there was no problems .
from that , you take them with -- on a solid , very narrow path , right from beginning to end .
if i happen to know someone who has this device that &apos;s made .
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition works for an old pattern ...
it was hopefully positive , positive , positive , even more positive .
if you follow my ideas , you &apos;ll have a <unk> presentation , and that &apos;s neat to <unk> who you are and engage in the wild .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a bug .
if you make a difference , you might have a impact on it .
and if you have enough enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , on the last room as the culture , innovation is not .
so , as we think and behavior , our <unk> break our <unk> .
we have a <unk> meme to be seriously .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
through an emergent change , change , like transparency , change , like <unk> , and collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on results .
because just the challenge the only way that things are done is the only way to get the <unk> to us , the old <unk> , to find new creative solutions to the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and we &apos;re going to share with bulgaria and play the ideas of play , we can turn bulgaria into something better .
the magazine for <unk> , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the <unk> because the <unk> of the time .
after i had a press aside , they were very -- and i was accepted and i worked for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we <unk> danny papers , we did our homework , but where we were looking at , we were surrounded by pictures like this .
this image was literally literally in seconds after i got the baby and put it over the arms and put it over .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : the miscarriage is not talking about his miscarriage -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better since i was born and family .
but you realize you &apos;re going to have a sense of <unk> that you &apos;re going to lose , which is , in a very sense , what we mean , our lives really is very much , and what is really a practical experience .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s this kind of episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine being big , already , <unk> , <unk> today , to hear how they would be personally playing with . john <unk> walker shows how footage can be used to <unk> and analyze it &apos;s <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
well , since then we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary economic <unk> , the longest <unk> in the history of this country .
but now a few months later , as good politicians are always liking to bite &quot; in the <unk> apple without biting the mine , &quot; as a person felt , your uncertainty cannot hide .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand this , until i met this guy , a back <unk> , slightly messy man that stopped himself with <unk> foods and iron for totally <unk> .
but also , the future also also does a future where society is a pair of <unk> from capitalism , which is , as you <unk> the dna <unk> innovation into society , by doing things like this , and then those who work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new findings that i &apos;ve been working on is about the relationship between the structure of the language that you &apos;re talking about and your propensity to save .
and if i want to speak correctly , forcing me to think about it constantly .
well , this is a <unk> theory .
if you press this device , you can actually get your hand hand with your <unk> hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in the pursuit of the future .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate with generations .
we &apos;re constantly <unk> .
but i &apos;m against it as a hurdle .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time i was in the field of <unk> medicine , although i was <unk> a ph.d. in <unk> .
people and <unk> and <unk> and everything that goes up the red line here . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused more serious about the future of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s look at the next video .
and this was the last night at the party , and you can see it just <unk> , and you can <unk> any <unk> you want to do .
and he was dissatisfied about how people were watching the buddhist religion in india in india .
and he goes back to the village as a <unk> man .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we get a lot of us , and we take the sense of a mother and a wide long thing on all of those living in this meditation .
and you think about how <unk> things are , if you &apos;re happy when you &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and <unk> to others .
even though the change in your mind is something for other living creatures , and you feel that new quality in you , and it helps you , and it &apos;s for you to be a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of the handle , one of the society used to get the public health in order to get the public health .
interestingly , complexity evolves very high .
we &apos;ve heard recently from bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> , and an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop you on the details , but in the lower right corner , you see an example of what we have .
did they start to do that ?
and this comes from the things that jimmy talked about , what &apos;s the new way of the organization , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are becoming less and less in the position , it &apos;s only going to be in the use , in conjunction with the <unk> .
let &apos;s say , for example , what yochai was talking about .
it &apos;s also becoming <unk> , professional arguments .
so it &apos;s not going to be a dispute of two camp , but between these camps , there are all sorts of interesting positions that are taken by people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to devote their <unk> to somebody and actually has made a team : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him .
but the truth is , life is going to happen right here .
so , people called the news and have news news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m attracted to how batman , to be my own clothes . &quot;
and the one that didn &apos;t have done , so it turned out , and it was made , that she was going to go in a different town and had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i &apos;ve been studying human behavior on the basis of everything , from the genes of cognition , dopamine and things like to <unk> .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on the gender .
this was one of those cases , because in her , there was no violence under your ancestors . but in my dad .
and they &apos;re so similar to just how to be .
by the way , i have an email that &apos;s going to get an email , and that &apos;s that we &apos;ve made the last part of atlas .
and these guys are there , the weak force that might be known to the least .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or the <unk> flakes , you should be able to add up with the <unk> , why dna has the shape that you &apos;ve now has .
the comparison is that people are in this room .
but it &apos;s really that , that this theory of theory of the theory of the big <unk> can seem to be the big <unk> , and it seems to be a great prediction . the model was not going to happen to do this , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful image , the darkness in light , and it allows to see the civilization from the space .
another big idea came from a study of popular university in 2010 , the baseball <unk> maps of the <unk> player in the <unk> of the <unk> .
in a similar study in germany , researchers are using an advanced <unk> to measure <unk> , and after they <unk> <unk> into their face , they had to <unk> smile .
&quot; because the colors that you have to have , not the european standard , he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? were going on here more policemen ? &quot;
we built the light <unk> that people , people from <unk> , they would think that they were traveling abroad , when they were <unk> to <unk> their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; do you think you can do something and you &apos;ve already done it for half . &quot;
all across the port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came together and offered the mobile phones .
one of the <unk> is the world for the <unk> of technology finding in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion emails in the world .
in the shops of the environment , batteries and bread were <unk> .
this flow of time is embedded in everything , in the erosion of a <unk> , in the <unk> mountains that are at the <unk> .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and also , if i look at the big bear , i remember how a child was going to be a kid to slide down his head to slide off his head , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve been seeing how creative technology can be and we &apos;re doing our own lives , and our own , we can do the solutions , innovations and moments , the flow of time , the flow of time , it &apos;s making it back .
my mom was <unk> .
in each one , they had to <unk> , they had to <unk> the soldiers who had my older brother mark , who was nine , take a child soldier .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to have from the suitcase .
and then i ended up in <unk> because i don &apos;t get my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything life is going to be about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should this be a role game ?
so , in theory , we can make any organ of any kind of organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the rotors goes at the same speed , the robot is going to be with the same .
and you can see how dense the control is .
and he does this while he <unk> down .
you take your neighbors .
this shows that we double the <unk> , triple , triple , <unk> , where we can bring them to make teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to upgrade your horizon , consciousness , and your view of honeybees .
this has been a big problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , the <unk> , the many different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
you don &apos;t experience that .
they take the cooks for their courts , and the honey -- there &apos;s <unk> -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying if they stick , so they wouldn &apos;t do it .
okay , now , really , is the question : why is this ?
of course , we &apos;ve been , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before they were not aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of you , that our bread was not the european invention .
and particularly the meat in <unk> and china is going to move up the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> for most people , and here are not many farmers among them to be bad , to <unk> the environment , to destroy the environment , to destroy the environment .
everything hangs on .
and so while i finished my bread , and i &apos;ve got it <unk> , and i &apos;m trying to burn the hands .
and also , it has to be to maintain the long time to keep the land where there are available tools and <unk> materials and <unk> .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyzed and testing , and developing a new technology , and it &apos;s certainly the quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is a year from this year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them , and shekhar kapur turned a movie , <unk> queen , who should see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient who was asked to -- he was needed to catch a bypass , decided for this .
i like this slide because you can talk about what people really want to do change , and what not do .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans eat more fat because the one , and even more carbs . so the percentage of the lower , but the actual number higher , the goal is to reduce both of them .
one of the most <unk> <unk> studies found that 70 percent of the people were <unk> , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent had a -- that &apos;s not healthy diet .
on the other hand , all of the time is , you know , <unk> is <unk> .
i hope it &apos;s not hanging down .
the film is based on a <unk> of plate scott <unk>
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had sufficient passion to make the <unk> and the technology .
we &apos;re so outraged for motion capture .
the number of seemed to be infinitely .
and that &apos;s the data that you get to you about , and then you &apos;re used to be used for this model .
and so the finished painting was being used in the movie .
it was a very , very early rehearsal .
and we found this in the state of karnataka , in karnataka .
and it has a <unk> .
the people of <unk> are being overcome these brutal , <unk> past , where they lived in life .
we were to <unk> -- two of them as a driver -- and imagine that this long is a ocean , 40 degrees centigrade , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best <unk> animal on the world . &quot;
and they use it as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another movie .
i don &apos;t <unk> until my body temperature temperature will transcend 40 degrees fahrenheit -- enough to watch a egg .
<unk> , thank you for inviting .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea .
but how would it like you like , if you had never knew how much god god would put the world , your shoulders in the clouds , or whether you &apos;re sitting down there , you &apos;re sitting down there with your little <unk> ?
who could quiet quiet in this night ?
but you knew that judy <unk> was going to be a french army , that <unk> d <unk> the french army had invented french army to defeat , blaise pascal &apos;s room -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
and they were sitting in a tree and a force hanging out to another .
and the human genome system is more than that , but if you remove those two columns , probably wouldn &apos;t be much left .
and also , we have , in elephants , the problem that you can &apos;t build construction that would be too heavy for an individual elephant .
one component of that is understanding . here &apos;s the ability to understand the feelings of the other and to share . &quot;
so now , let &apos;s explore more complicated terms . here &apos;s some more comfort .
that the test wasn &apos;t out good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple job that you have to do .
and a philosopher wrote us that it was impossible that a sense of fairness would be impossible to make sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now , it &apos;s not a lonely mad , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot of a lot of power news .
the last decade i spent the last decade , i &apos;ve been <unk> , and i &apos;m not to say , &quot; hopefully , a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say thank you .
so i stopped , in a sense , it was a success .
and the years , the <unk> can cause severe <unk> .
a.j. jacobs : how life life makes me almost .
and i think that many <unk> are sharing this view .
really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically <unk> , and they were <unk> , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask after the part of the story that &apos;s not told .
... a preacher ?
but finally , a group that believes the indus people are the ancestors of the people in today &apos;s brain .
on the right , how many ? okay .
it can be useful in the <unk> useful , more data that then <unk> are <unk> .
this sign is the most frequent script , and just in this text , it &apos;s going to be twice .
it turns out there &apos;s a long time tradition , names on the basis of <unk> at the time of the birth .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this string of wire was the <unk> that would make the name of bell famous .
and , in the historic discovery , the historic discovery was made that bodies as <unk> as they can be .
actually all the young people in the city .
somebody who &apos;s sitting next to you , and that &apos;s okay in a <unk> , you would be sitting on a <unk> , and somebody would sit as close to you , you would <unk> .
the dalai lama always says -- he says , if you &apos;re going to see the idea of the <unk> , it &apos;s because you realize that you &apos;re yourself and your pain and joys of creating a small playground for your own intelligence .
but take this wonderful thing , the <unk> showed us , it was afraid of a <unk> .
a man in a tank was a picture that was convicted to the world for a symbol of opposition .
but what would you not have anything to do anything , if you had the modern communications , to make a sense that the wrong is that , what had to be done , would have to be done to be done immediately ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and to create global level , and to organize global level with the challenges that we now now , and the most of global nature is .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photo of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of children were <unk> , who were left , when the <unk> of the <unk> had died of rwanda .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a vibrant , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
they can vary on very different <unk> -- they vary in the <unk> , the motion of the surface and the <unk> .
this is a floating <unk> here .
boy : <unk> .
slow down , we slow down the spines .
mark cutkosky , at stanford , one of my mate is an extraordinary engineer who developed a technology called <unk> <unk> , where he can put them directly into a artificial foot .
they &apos;re almost like aliens , and the secret to stick what they stick is their <unk> toes .
we put it down .
these <unk> structures allow the spines to <unk> and the <unk> , to capture very <unk> , difficult surfaces .
so , <unk> long , <unk> , which is to be used as a <unk> and the male as a woman , and to find one mate and choose a mate .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet from each other , they have to produce less than half the time they create .
if we think about animals like dolphins , we need to be about the consequences of our surgeries in the clear that we &apos;re pretty benign for quite perfect .
after the <unk> , the marine <unk> has made these systems to learn what scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females are using this signal to find a mate and they &apos;re scattered across , they imagine what will have given the <unk> of the world of the population of the population .
how ships can be made , they found that with a better <unk> <unk> of that noise is going to be reduced 90 percent .
they &apos;re going to the speed up 50 percent .
we see foreign worlds , we see foreign <unk> , 300 years , and it &apos;s always getting more and more and more and more and more and more .
you have all the opportunity to have .
we &apos;re seeing a continuous rise among men .
and obviously there &apos;s also one , the hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars , they &apos;re going to give me the idea that we &apos;re going to introduce a whole new generation of people into the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think nothing is that the problem .
our daily lives is , but they said , in a remarkable state , we say in a <unk> .
normally it &apos;s one or two a year .
and there &apos;s it !
but we &apos;re much more powerful .
part of the challenge was to try and not just <unk> the room by just just my hands -- the juggling is a lot of <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and they &apos;re going to play .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , let me give you a little hint .
now again , and finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you &apos;ve got someone up here , the most fundamental principle of all of it , is to do this whole life , ok ?
<unk> -- and then it comes to the quiet . just a little number over time .
and the room and the space is working in a different way .
and then moved on .
in this year -- could you take the slides -- in this year , we carry the <unk> with us , a project where we &apos;ve been helped by the back of design .
we can go to a <unk> program , which is to make more information about the clothing , whereas you &apos;re having these <unk> .
( scott adams : i &apos;ve found that i &apos;m going to be the leading expert expert in the <unk> .
and we also give this new product today , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s been presented in public .
now , the farmers just can just harvest in the rainy season , not the <unk> harvest .
electrons go into a kind of <unk> , and then it &apos;s still energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought was what he was there .
potatoes , potatoes , have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the purpose of it , <unk> ?
we &apos;ve been doing this for about four years .
if google is being a book , it &apos;s a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , the middle of the 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine it &apos;s not going to be interested .
but also a lot of the right there that seems to be the <unk> of propaganda .
if you dig up the <unk> , it means a &quot; <unk> &quot; with a a.
if i make this pink sound for longer than a few minutes , they would literally stop listening .
many people get too <unk> , but they turn up large , public spaces like this , divided <unk> , millions of tiny , little personal .
you can also do this in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , an aesthetic .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you very much for you guys , and we &apos;re all grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they weren &apos;t on us in the front sidewalk and couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my <unk> , a exchange , which is to us fair , but <unk> .
now , i &apos;m saying , in the <unk> , there was a lot of competition in the last year , because arab spring is still expanding , the <unk> is , what else ?
this photograph actually taken up in a police station , and on the ground , they &apos;re going to see the <unk> of the people who are being heard of the police .
the kids just make photographs in a class , the teachers get them , they &apos;re <unk> them on the <unk> .
in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , <unk> , somewhere there is a <unk> .
this is something that we can work in our lifetimes , i think i can make a difference , and so i was trying to get out of the <unk> where i was going to work .
but sometimes science has some other traits that they really make interesting really interesting .
what do we bring us more data ?
there &apos;s something we believe , it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by a prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the taste as very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we developed the <unk> part of the <unk> , the <unk> part of the neocortex . nature has done this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you see there and say , &quot; what do i see ?
not like a <unk> . it &apos;s not about the slightest <unk> .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need a police , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your board . &quot;
she traveled because she was the time of elections outside the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when they closed the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash this : by hand .
this group uses three , everybody .
it &apos;s real .
she made english to learn english and learning this as a second language .
the computer , you know , and in one of three people .
if you think , unlike the religious family of the united states , who were actually part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
we repeated this experiment with the same groups , but we would put a shutter between the enlightenment about how we deal with the data , and the actual actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price of that is the displacement of paradise .
and they moved and then <unk> and then they had their arms up and <unk> their arms up and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we really are really lousy at talking about character .
then you ask personal coaches , the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> for bad breath in <unk> .
i feel not really good at emotions .
the first gift that the first gift or talent is <unk> -- the ability to peer people &apos; minds and find out what they have to offer .
they own <unk> humility .
that &apos;s what the subconscious mean is .
we found them between <unk> , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey begin ?
and it &apos;s not natural to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
so , lexicography is being brought together to be in .
well , first of all , i blame the queen , because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- see if someone thinks about a place and then you don &apos;t find it on the map , then he &apos;s thinking , &quot; this card is <unk> ! &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to give our mind expression , where do you know that it &apos;s better than hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different <unk> definitions of the set .
and then this mike <unk> . mike <unk> is living in the u.k.
i &apos;ve got the whole time &quot; the dictionary , &quot; the dictionary , &quot; the dictionary &quot; said .
so , i get a chair .
and to make a long story short , here i am .
and so , by a piece , while this three days , you start with that , understand , why am i hear all of this stuff i &apos;m going to do ?
you may have been from a ted and so we can run the conversation during the year , and next year , and the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers are not in <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a such precise diagnostic system that could actually locate fold on the palm of the palm of the palm of the palm .
there was uncertain if it was <unk> , and was technically not able to find the manufacturers .
instead of corrupt , you &apos;re going to make you .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> &amp; amp ; d <unk> and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this is a cartoon of a <unk> person .
we debate the thesis &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear , &quot; right or wrong ?
and so there &apos;s only three <unk> of this -- coal and gas , <unk> that &apos;s almost all over the whole -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads of the <unk> by turning electricity .
<unk> emissions are the equivalent emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that are warming , warming and to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons , because we know , for example , india and pakistan had <unk> nuclear weapons in <unk> .
and for wind , the area is much bigger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is , 21 states has nuclear power , right ?
and the <unk> of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- just one or two voices need to take the global warming in the senate , and this room can help help .
we &apos;re just going to get enough energy sources .
i used to worry about the 10 years of the time .
thank you .
that was -- my motivation was convicted of apollo <unk> .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that will allow us to move forward to space exploration .
26 groups from seven countries took the competition , every one had a million dollars in one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can put them on the space station .
and the advantage for the funders community is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would you be surprised to us , fascinating ?
that means that surfaces can be able to do . they can become incredibly small .
and a challenge was how we can express this new algorithmic order to the column .
what i didn &apos;t know about the time , because we &apos;ve seen the outside , was that the space goes on , within the column , the column , it was quite surprising discovery .
<unk> algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms with millions of animal , no human could make them by hand , but you can build it , and they could revolutionize our understanding of architecture .
so look at this image here -- lots of shapes dancing here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip <unk> , even the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s been run by young people .
and i think there are many people in the room , many of them are in the same position as i do .
so i think women are going to become leaders in our society , because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve recognized that since the other day , has more people use tools like youtube and social networks to give their stories to their stories , and to show their photos and their whole own stories of their own voices .
and at the same time , we &apos;re going to invite you to explore and explore our part of the world .
so i became more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; well , if i do some of these ants , they pull it up . &quot;
this was called &quot; <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , you know , five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always get .
and i took it around , and i shaped it .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very <unk> work , but the best things are coming in small <unk> .
you expect to expect to do your employees , you ask them what you asked them to do , if you &apos;ve been doing the task , you can do extra .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , consciousness , a perfect heart of compassion and love of the primary attributes of the divine .
my <unk> body flew in the direction , my <unk> wheel .
i was asked all the <unk> i would probably do with you , the <unk> i would not be able to buy , the friends i would see , the <unk> i could not walk with them .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you <unk> you from the back of the back , you can just go over it and you make it <unk> in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors had cut off and hoping , and there was a 15 year-old chance of survival .
as i became more and more people , and at this point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds of lighter than i am now .
and no one , these modern <unk> of my eyes more than david black .
and walk upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international union for <unk> what &apos;s the least <unk> name is that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three and a half months , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so once i was trying to get the piano , i was <unk> <unk> .
and at the end you were so quickly , things like the flight of the flight of the bumblebee no problem , right ?
would you like to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t <unk> that .
they &apos;re fighting about their own life in this forest , in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that &apos;s still not yet <unk> , in a world that &apos;s still not yet .
so we know that today , that you are capable of being able to do research for absolutely impossible , when i started .
the long term supporting connection to mom , who developed during this long childhood , and the siblings , can keep the whole life , and that can be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it &apos;s also a huge <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the woods , and so the pygmies that are falling in the <unk> and the <unk> of so many years lived in the <unk> .
yesterday , one said that .
now , there &apos;s now in every state , and the problems in florida are others than new york .
come down and down me here ?
there &apos;s the politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is that pretty much the same , but with a few dozen different kinds of molecules -- such a <unk> reduction in complexity , but the trial is trying to create something more .
it &apos;s actually very <unk> . if you &apos;re acting , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all the experts in these , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells , play with these devices .
and then we see the self-assembly of these bodies from <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black <unk> is actually represent these black mud -- these <unk> , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin <unk> put out of chemicals , the <unk> of chemicals that are living like living behavior , and his work reveals how life came first to happen in earth , and maybe other places .
this is a <unk> <unk> to lead your tadpole to a walk .
what &apos;s the thing that &apos;s -- how did you know ? they took it .
but if we did that in every single term -- every fire , we could redefine the case of emergency .
so , the <unk> is the filth that is otherwise , in its pretty pink lungs , and it &apos;s being associated with -- with them .
the birds could jump from one to the other .
you can talk about the news of him . you can talk to them .
but these herd will be a big toll of our planet .
next , we &apos;re all <unk> skin cells and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working for thousands of years , with <unk> , <unk> , and they were <unk> , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re doing our research , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people to own a car .
let me talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge <unk> energy to create mobile energy .
if we can see those twinkling future , also , can also see that .
you had to survive .
and we certainly made sure of our school district , to be given to funding and support support .
because why should our students go far away from their lives ?
it became a book , then a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
this is the west coast of the west coast , they were devastated .
but in this picture , you see , how we &apos;ve started building the <unk> that &apos;s been a big <unk> court .
when i came to the time , my <unk> studies , i studied the <unk> subject of the <unk> study .
if you go to the south , you see the expansion of new york city as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are protected from the <unk> of protected places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , insects and <unk> sites .
maybe a <unk> da there .
and so much force in connecting science and visualizing together is that these images are coming up . it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we &apos;re now in our society , and we &apos;re now a really dramatic level of that .
so i don &apos;t have to go into it .
you can just upgrade , of course , to remain .
this is a <unk> building .
so , one of the things we all know is that the cell phones .
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and more invasive manner .
but it &apos;s all over the place , and these tools are pieces of them to help us create it .
i &apos;m serious -- you &apos;re quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you could think that a big problem could be a law , but congress seems not to be very uncomfortable from that .
but if you make lots of high-quality copies and selling them , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we &apos;ve made things that we found , and every single option of the horror in that industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very charming , <unk> , expensive training in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought i &apos;m going to start a barefoot college -- college for the poor .
a professional person is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and conviction .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire power comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how to be arrested , what you should do if you were arrested what you should do , if an animal is sick .
and then it comes in there , you get off the way to tension , you get to the schools , and it &apos;s going to be between teachers and parents , so the puppets can call the teachers and the parents &apos; the <unk> and say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use language language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , sir president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> create one of the largest , dynamic computers in the world for this kind of <unk> .
you see the <unk> along the <unk> , which we have as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data data from these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to physically go to physically , financially , emotionally , emotionally , mentally , and in almost every other way , &quot; i don &apos;t have a minute . &quot;
he would not loan him to him and naturally , ray <unk> six months later the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used in the experiment that i will be used to report to you , <unk> from <unk> images .
we collected our materials , went out of the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
they <unk> two images , and they now had two beautiful <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> of for all of them , and we said , &quot; what would you like to make ? &quot;
we take a completely new set of <unk> , and say , &quot; you know , we give a <unk> and we can make it on two different ways .
<unk> , the big car and the <unk> flight is beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the <unk> of <unk> , but goes back to a time , even before we were on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the sort of <unk> ceiling , you know , you know .
and so we had my father <unk> , because i knew he would kill me if i left it alone , so we get into the car .
&quot; and had this guy about a blue uniform and a <unk> look at the face ? &quot;
i really want to put it in ? because if i don &apos;t have the <unk> to get stuck to <unk> -- enough metaphor for your taste ? -- could it be , i never come back out .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret agent .
she says , &quot; ma , you must look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old lady , damn , again ! &quot;
it &apos;s gone from the car . &quot;
i really am really afraid .
so what is the social result of that ?
where can i go today and who put together ?
and if we have it , we &apos;re going to decide how many kilometers we drive , where we live and work .
intelligent , <unk> , <unk> , and you see exactly where your bus is walking along and when it comes and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want we to launch the wireless <unk> <unk> , and i urge that the network of open standards to everybody is accessible to everyone .
and they came here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who come across a psychiatric disease , you know what a challenge is to be .
i said i wanted to tell you the <unk> , i wanted to share with you three a <unk> from fantastic , and i wanted to leave you with a <unk> .
because they were all old .
and so what i love about this story is that , rosey grier is simply an authentic person , and that &apos;s why authenticity is .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in clean <unk> .
j there are so many that the vision has become problematic .
i found it strange about this as if it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
the total of the most pessimistic , a white rich <unk> , who was not paying attention to the city .
it &apos;s pretty simple , but this was a <unk> .
people <unk> over two things -- they were astonished by the destruction , but there was also a sense of <unk> over the <unk> of new yorkers that i found very emotional .
because at looking at all of these four platforms along the <unk> -- which is a <unk> version of a <unk> -- we knew that if you had to be <unk> , to respond to <unk> conditions and the changed definition of ground zero .
we have the ability to think about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that kids suffer every year in pathology .
if -- heaven forbid -- someone &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> , most of us would fully <unk> the most of us in a period of a period of a few hours to a few weeks .
you have to be familiar with the issues that we &apos;re talking about today .
and it turns out , tom saw a helmet , a helmet , for 20 dollars , was a good way to maintain a 100,000 <unk> .
it &apos;s not true , but it happened to tony blair during the davos of the 20th century , when his doodle , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; were described , and he was described as this .
in other words , they have a shared and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s happening in <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all of countries are committed to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that have been at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the drug companies , their patents <unk> and they available to them .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> , and people were sitting in the <unk> sun , afternoon at very high and they didn &apos;t think they were .
you can adjust everything to worry about your well-being .
it &apos;s got all these services , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so little things that you do for a long time , but for people who are going to connect with the digital world .
the question was , how do you make out of this teacher from this teacher .
let &apos;s see what he &apos;s doing here .
and the husband &apos;s daughter , he was also sick with the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
well , <unk> had a <unk> of our studies .
well , if we feel emotion , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people have a different structural position within the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both from carbon , and yet one of them <unk> in a special way , which are a special way , on the left , and they get <unk> , that &apos;s soft and dark .
so to reiterate something , let me take a second for a moment .
and then finally , is not easy .
under the same circumstances , older people are affecting their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more and memory , more positive information than that .
we &apos;re going to cost life .
and they made me wish , &quot; tonight i &apos;m going to put this <unk> for this girl on this bar mitzvah . &quot;
kid david : so it &apos;s so that i &apos;m not really sure what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve been called me brother and uncles , and i &apos;ve been invited to over five years over a period of time .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort laramie was clearly clearly the sovereignty of the great sioux , and the <unk> of the lakota , over the sacred black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie demanded that at least three quarter of the <unk> had to sign to the land of land .
they were tired of the treaties .
the <unk> is eight times as high as the american average .
so what are we going to do ?
and today , child mortality rates dropped from 24 percent to today &apos;s year .
you can either get it to a pill or a syringe . you have to take it every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we were to do it , like , here with people ...
but basically , it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s like , are you smarter than a <unk> ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is , this car is safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on , of course , i use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something different than actually , is an effective weapon of vaccine .
what &apos;s not new .
the lights are going to be dark .
we do it for our customer .
we have the sun in the sun .
now , logic , you see , you &apos;re looking at this position in this position , without moving your wrist .
i &apos;m going to be now . if every time , every time , another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;ll present some of the <unk> .
here , i have to look after looking for the beginning of the <unk> , so i can follow my cards during the <unk> -- oh , we should have started together -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what kind of card can i use ? the lady or five ?
lg : but you see the hand .
right now , wait a minute , please , a card .
another suit . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yeah ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all cards are crossing -- there &apos;s all the cards -- you know ?
and finally , the king -- five seconds .
some of them seem to know this child .
after i was back , i made my entire company to a <unk> . &quot;
if you had no musical hearing , you couldn &apos;t get a car .
let &apos;s see what happens here .
i &apos;m always saying to my students , &quot; if you always hold a <unk> eyebrows , you can see it every day . &quot;
imagine the person , and they &apos;re following the whole path from b to e , and you &apos;ll hear anything that was going to be in the chopin .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years , and i suddenly had a realization .
she came to auschwitz , when she was 15 years old , her brother was eight , her parents were <unk> her .
so , ladies and gentlemen , you look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
for tasks of the 21st century , this is the <unk> , <unk> don &apos;t work -- often not , and they often do harm damage .
think about your own work .
the standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of a whole new seed of our businesses .
this one day of intense autonomy has led to a whole series of <unk> that might never have existed .
make it because you like to make it .
and it &apos;s used because of its easy weight .
in a series of 55 people , they are clinging to , in contrast , every sphere and their distances are proportionate , to the little earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows in the other direction .
this has developed a lot of <unk> .
the <unk> on the object would probably be a very <unk> picture of the earth .
but it &apos;s always about the 10 percent or more , most of the most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a group of <unk> dollars .
charitable organizations need to have to go back , courageous , big , big , new <unk> , to try and say that it &apos;s going to put their reputation through the dirt .
so what should you do ?
the overhead is now .
dan <unk> : our thinking about charity
then there were the <unk> listeners , yeah , that part of their stuff had to have their <unk> .
people who &apos;ve done this <unk> , the <unk> , all of these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about the execution of music as it was written , not for the interpretation . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , authority is available when you &apos;re needed . that &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is happening to the process .
as a <unk> , we tell ourselves many stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .
there are 98 percent of the world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s also not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes really joy .
they think about whether they should move it forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have the transition criminal health system , we would have to invent this entire whole system of infrastructure to first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
budgets are not really balanced . and to a certain extent , just the games that they play to keep this , and the subject is so much that you can &apos;t see what the really obvious challenges are .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really just four states that are not going to stand up with this big challenge .
and even if you &apos;ve just been living in this way , you could put money on there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> , but i was visiting <unk> <unk> , and i was in a <unk> of my life , and i was trying to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after solar-powered clocks , i knew that sex might be so good about the five senses .
and the <unk> demo with good sex with a extreme level .
of course , the five senses are not the only thing that makes life worthwhile .
we &apos;re all born as artists .
if you have a conversation , the child has to come up with the next answer to <unk> what it started .
but your parents say , &quot; it &apos;s all heating from the waves . &quot;
but kids are usually making art . it &apos;s play .

it &apos;s also the <unk> .
all right . they are <unk> of behavior , and they &apos;re <unk> of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all of the facts . we don &apos;t know what the tools that are , or what we &apos;re going to have to look for in the context to be able to get there before the different behavior is .
how are you going to scale it ? &quot;
three are all the same , although they &apos;re all equally in different ways , one of them is magical , the other two are like work , i like to do this books because they have a very special thing to do .

what &apos;s interesting as soon as you pour it -- and by the way -- this is from <unk> -- to show all the artifacts of modern comics : <unk> <unk> , simple line without <unk> and a <unk> from the left to right .

this is daniel <unk> &apos;s <unk> in britain .

goodbye mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last bar ?

the <unk> and the copy worked at first .

misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of political <unk> is the hackers that &apos;s <unk> .
the net connects everything , and it &apos;s very soon to communicate a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous is doing its <unk> information , but it doesn &apos;t profit .
he explained to me how he went to tour in new york , and 2004 , he took 10,000 dollars from the atm machines , 30,000 dollars from the atms to use <unk> credit cards .
he was born in <unk> in a stable and respect class of his face , his obsession with playing with play as a teenager , his obsession with a <unk> .
and most of the people , with the exception of the script and <unk> , they had no real social skills in the outside world -- just in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons , i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some of the mention .
but they &apos;re all of the market , and what the market is powering is number one is the big demographic <unk> .
we also found a lot of examples of the <unk> of these big boxes that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be <unk> through the <unk> of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped help me to become eight of 13 <unk> <unk> <unk> plans in <unk> plans .
the stream was <unk> by the parking lot .
their residents are different than the typical of <unk> , but they &apos;re less <unk> than cities .
&quot; his vagina &quot; said she &apos;s a whole <unk> . &quot;
but actually , it wasn &apos;t there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender of gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way that really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies in our minds -- that this separation has created a division that has also made the chance of the decision that we often overcome .
i want to tell this little story about my own very beginnings , because it &apos;s very much to happiness with the happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s in my <unk> , south carolina , not much smaller than the age today , and once of a future , a <unk> of independent country .
well , maybe he was too uncomfortable , because he was staying where he was , and he was staying in budapest , and even after the <unk> and <unk> , started in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; get me the best workers you can find , and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to ask you . &quot;
and so it &apos;s clearly saying , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all that beautiful .
&quot; ah ha ! &quot; i said to dr. robicsek . &quot; i &apos;ve gone through the movie alone . &quot;
as i said , he <unk> too much .
and you can really imagine .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re looking for the most difficult of the hard , and we order to order to the other day for the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went with , during the time of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to push you so long , it &apos;s going to push it for the more .
what i want to try to try and do i hope to illustrate this is what i &apos;m doing .
and what i want to point out later on the presentation , 50 percent of the united states is under the ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> there , because the photons are not able to reach the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> kilometers . the <unk> is on <unk> miles .
and so we drove along the <unk> area , and they found a lot of the <unk> , and found the missing heat .
so i started developing a new <unk> , with a <unk> that i have to go to get up in my car .
we find the <unk> in the state of the <unk> .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s in seattle . ok .
but i would have a child without license license control of my tax .
in some parts of the world , there &apos;s been difficult to <unk> education .
when we saw the effect of the <unk> , then andrew and i decided we had to increase the way to provide the best education .
what was the special part of these classes ?
the video will be interrupted all the few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues that multiple <unk> isn &apos;t so bad about that .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask yourself , which are the most <unk> and how to help the students to remediate these .
we even see the advent of either , by a personalized , or by <unk> feedback , we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe and what my first thought was , what lies in mind when i was a kid .
and in our society , of course , is mostly to make the reality of others .
i mean , my doubt about the values of designer science , like rationality , it &apos;s expected to be rational .
so you can understand my surprise , when i got to read the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of <unk> <unk> , says , ayn rand is his <unk> mentor .
i think you can do about those funny , which have no <unk> , that &apos;s not , and that &apos;s because i don &apos;t have any joke about <unk> <unk> and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;ve been doing this as a really old time of the <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you .
he said i had to pay him more respect , because it &apos;s going to take 18 years to get a really good arguer .
huh ? yeah ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that active somebody doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve been thinking about <unk> thinking about beauty that you were told yesterday , and &quot; golden &quot; in his book says that that trickster can sometimes bring beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom is , we need to pay for the price . &quot;
ten years ago , the astronomer in the world was not going to have come on the idea -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there &apos;s planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he <unk> the time that a experiment can go wrong with a particle particle , and then it could cause a threshold of a particle , the world .
we need to be able to do the same <unk> , and like <unk> .
we don &apos;t want to see one of them .
what can we do about this ?
and now the worst part .
we spend very big money on making sure that we don &apos;t die at a <unk> , but we don &apos;t give almost nothing . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught in the wrong way .
i hope that will .
it &apos;s very , very important because this is the system , the <unk> , which is where the life came on the planet , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight , and we just know about it .
and that &apos;s what the system <unk> , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in this circles .
anyone who came up later , and it &apos;s simply to get the database , and can make the information that &apos;s needed for anything that &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;re about the wave , the technological opportunity .
in a earthquake , huge amounts of these new microbes that we &apos;ve never seen before the sea floor .
<unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that creates our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and to make a <unk> about the world of the deep world .
so i think that optimism is going forward forward .
so again , radical is radical .
the <unk> against the <unk> , you know , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desire are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , is becoming unexpected .
but i &apos;m rather unknown , and even with horror , rather than again the same thing constantly constantly , so it &apos;s hollowed out of its own .
and the risks of spaces that were never as much as they were in a groundbreaking city .
there &apos;s the emotions of victims .
daniel libeskind : a very big ideas . he calls up 17 terms of the ideas that he calls architecture -- raw , <unk> , <unk> , radically -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the cars that size .
if you really , you know , something really about , or will it just give a few more <unk> ?
em : you need to just say it . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and then you &apos;re putting out the <unk> <unk> on the roof , and you &apos;re going to calculate the <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , which is smaller than the energy consumption .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve come across it .
it &apos;s kind of like a jet jet .
how about everything in the world could be a <unk> ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re eating our livestock and you see a <unk> like he eats one of our goats , he &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we were suffering from hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every <unk> , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so far , we were able to bring the world wildlife fund , to bring the whole small idea to programs to bring on to the problem of <unk> .
very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment about aids and hiv .
<unk> -- always a <unk> among many people in the world of <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we &apos;re hiding this prize for the enormous winning behind these enormous winning .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> are passionate about the <unk> revolution for <unk> food .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that were the known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
science is looking through the intellect , quantitatively , things that are measured and described , but they are the art to know a framework for knowledge and knowledge .
from the plan of a few cameras , a few cameras has been a plan with 25 <unk> plan .
this is the natural cycle .
this would not usually be a <unk> photographer , a photograph that &apos;s right , right ? but sometimes it must be to show the dimensions .
so here you see the glacier &apos;s moving back .
and this has seen several cameras .
could india be the origins or a global center for innovation , just like a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
if we were talking to people in these <unk> , they were working on , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a <unk> , if you weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for cancer for cancer , and in <unk> , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a recent <unk> <unk> in the morning .
i said , i know a <unk> message when i see one .
everyone in our society is going to touch cancer , if not personal , then by one beloved people , a family member , a friend , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve been using tumor treating fields in the lab , and we see this effect on all of it .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in the six months of the tumor , it starts <unk> .
it &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new <unk> , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collecting rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their own .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , it looks like this .
somewhere , a stream or a <unk> by this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english we have <unk> and water .
and they have to go to fall off .
these are the beautiful ones we &apos;ve just seen on one of the images .
and <unk> are at 27 percent : 600,000 times of people have been down , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
ten percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in the textiles that people are taking people from the <unk> and bring them to industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries at the right , you see the <unk> , basically , every country with a <unk> , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of saying three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india wasn &apos;t so right .
buy african products .
but i think a lot of a lot of a problem is that this logic -- that we should be ipods and not bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title of a <unk> new book .
so , 500 people would have been selected to be four people and to go to the school room and they &apos;re selected to be blogging about it .
so now , if you &apos;re in planning , in planning , not necessarily anything to change , because it &apos;s still the dictators that are the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : the internet makes momentous expectations
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was hanging down with us younger guys around .
because for me , who lived in this period of time and in this <unk> , was called the question : &quot; do you want sex or drugs -- and drugs we didn &apos;t .
i was paralyzed , people .
so , as indians , and now politicians and <unk> are actually quite about the <unk> , which is our country , concerned , all the talk about india as new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , all of us , all kinds of <unk> stories about countries , regardless of whether they want to get the day or not the day .
but the lightning bolt of our country at the time was pretty slow , took it about half an hour until so a call .
she cannot understand the conversation .
so , there &apos;s sometimes an unintended consequences . ok .
and these of you who have been given their money to see the money , may be surprised , like many <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> are going to be shown .
i went home and i was doing a little bit , and i found some shocking statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a <unk> of water .
and now i feel like george bush .
well , this title , this is , comes from a critic , an early critic , and this is a passage i just love , and i would like to read them .
and this is a good thing , because if it would be like , &quot; nature would have a problem : how do you get the chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part that &apos;s not obvious , and so i &apos;ve picked it for the end .
ok ? stop . this is going to be done .
i don &apos;t know why there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but anyway , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually suspect that the most important community of probably are probably quite a lot of reasons why we want to make new things very , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should see something like this .
bob mckim has another very , very famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned this with time : you can get a much better deal with a lot more creative results if everybody &apos;s keeping the rules .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit , i &apos;ll come back to that .
you know , how it feels , all of these insecurity , as long as you go back to the corridor , the doctors <unk> in one of the <unk> , and you wonder what &apos;s going on .
so we would feel secure and would feel secure and would have a good time , because we were going to agree on the rules and to agree with it .
we &apos;re doing everything that leads to success , but then we &apos;re there , we &apos;ve done it . we lean <unk> and listen to all of that , to do all that , to do that .
i was faster , but just as depressed .
i &apos;ve learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully , for always , the last time , the public .
he made sure everything all fit together .
it took 900 people in this .
and the second is that people seem to experience a very actual connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern democracies , the society , the state , the state of us will not just determine our self , but it &apos;s also asking us .
it means that we meet full potential of human beings .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions i wanted to share with you today -- the question : what are the intentions that are coming to the application when you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> , we have to give us better practices .
and we were successful .
i &apos;ll give you a fall .
he <unk> her in the right position , <unk> them with his nose .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be any kind of <unk> to the observe lots of force and the speed that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load cell is measuring forces , and that &apos;s actually a <unk> load cell with a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and this will make a <unk> and on the load cell .
a very , very <unk> solution to the special problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think this is one of the most beautiful , <unk> <unk> that were ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even more <unk> , that just benefit that this is a three-dimensional space .
now you see that -- he &apos;s just hanging me up .
the submarine last year , this is the right one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , and please excuse the obvious example -- isn &apos;t the right approach to vote .
in fact , new york had been built on the back of the <unk> , our streets of their shells .
in those eight <unk> , they put little <unk> , which are practically <unk> .
so , you walked around in london , and i was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
after the end of the snow , the map of the outbreak was .
and this happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the tip of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of amazon , we discovered in the amazon .
the other side of the field is formal <unk> where actually inspired osama bin laden &apos;s supposed to stop . this is <unk> .
this was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me continue to continue and see the hubble <unk> of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter , and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s the part of the universe that &apos;s going to be the beginning of the universe .
we &apos;ve only got one million galaxies .
so the stuff that seems to be aware of it , dark matter .
and when you saw this image for the first time , you haven &apos;t seen a lot of it .
this simulation was taken up with 1,000 processors for a month , just just to make this visible here .
and with <unk> , we &apos;re going to have a resolution that is about this image of the earth , which is actually the complicated pattern of earth .
and we &apos;re actually in the process of course .
forty-seven percent .
it &apos;s crazy . we do that , even in everyday life .
i got a vicious cycle that led to many pain and problems that i could almost never hold anything .
so i asked myself , could you be creative , if you seek to search with the limitations ?
and this whole happened not from today .
the total <unk> is <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> . there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> monitor on the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s race , the <unk> , killing millions of <unk> , and in the &apos; 40s they were looking at the nazis , the <unk> , were burned , and many of the women at the time were trafficked as a <unk> .
that &apos;s the grief . &quot;
and as a <unk> , i was excited to the idea that what we &apos;ve learned in the virtual world about ourselves , and about our identity , use to be able to use a better life in the real world .
we used to get into a new way in common alone .
human relationships are statistics , chaotic and <unk> .
it <unk> them .
because the moment that people are alone , even for a few seconds , they will be <unk> , they would panic , they &apos;re going to take advantage after a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger because truth is the opposite .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we had not had any <unk> of the <unk> , some of our students , predicted , and quite often -- quite often , i felt they had been making a prediction on financial services .
maybe my father &apos;s been reading to us .
so i made them quiet with it -- but i had to say it was right and i had to be .
and finally , i thought a lot of that , but i don &apos;t have time to go into it .
even though you lose , not fear of failure , if we gave it all the time , because who can make a person more than to give than anything that he can .
if i should call the name , i never know one answer .
did i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells for heart disease .
only last month , it &apos;s been able to show us with this technology , to show the creation of human rights systems .
and we can map them and then turn them into a <unk> , and so the kidney will analyze all of their <unk> properties , and then we can just take this information and then put them through a <unk> print .
i couldn &apos;t get too much . i was just dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yeah , i want to do this surgery . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new section is called <unk> .
and connected with these <unk> , there were examples of the world -- the choice of a president to <unk> wikipedia and everything that lies in between -- the ones showed what the power could achieve a lot of .
third , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want to make the music she &apos;s playing .
i &apos;m <unk> joseph and i &apos;m a member in kenya .
we have to <unk> our women and children , we have to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
late night i went home with batteries and ice .
together : did anyone have a <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to give up the master &apos;s <unk> in moscow and working on to work on this .
that can be huge amounts of spending , but if the city can gain a number of x volunteers for y hours , the <unk> of the <unk> work for the <unk> of the city .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes that i &apos;ve been given to speak to speak here , between two and <unk> people who are going to go to the city .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the building here have several stories .
these green things are interdependent .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution , which would be true .
think about it . these men who don &apos;t have the same <unk> as i was helping me to get their engaged support , <unk> tendencies in their behalf .
at the time , <unk> was normally <unk> with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read any <unk> .
but you know , i find it very lonely to let me read machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , to transport these books in the <unk> , the u.k. , usa , canada , canada , australia , new zealand , all the different <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> . life has doubled over since <unk> and it &apos;s increasing with a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . wish , i want to be lucky , okay ?
secondly , the new machine is such a good news message , because once the androids take work , we don &apos;t have to do that , and we have to have <unk> and <unk> .
societal challenges for solving the social challenges of the world inequality .
the economic playbook is surprising , and surprising is , especially in short perspective .
and my greatest concern is that we create a world with <unk> technologies , embedded in a slightly more useful society and supported by an economy in which inequality .
and over the course of the years , i began to feel more <unk> with this notion of god .
some have <unk> that we can only believe in a god that divides our pain .
in the second , the sun &apos;s &quot; wind and waves obey them . &quot;
so , who &apos;s god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the <unk> soul of the universe .
by looking for god in search , and i &apos;m going to <unk> my own <unk> .
one of the first things i started to investigate was the history of the <unk> &quot; technology . &quot;
we haven &apos;t found any <unk> that older than 40 years , and the average age of these hunters and collectors tribes are 20 to 30 .
our body has to be used to these new diet .
so this is a sameness of energy and matter that einstein showed , and the modern science of <unk> shows that entropy and information and material and energy and all connected to each other , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to offend his own plug in order to get more power .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great development that has begun billions of years ago , moving through us and continues . and our choice is kind of <unk> , and our choice is kind of , really , is right in that power , that is much more powerful than ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classes 30 to 40 students .
we took it all down and found beautiful <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it had -- while we &apos;ve been having a ship , &quot; you know what , it looks like a ship &apos;s hull . &quot;
so we waited , we sat down at the tables and waited .
there are lots of <unk> . the only problem , particularly for the adults that are working at the <unk> , which didn &apos;t know anything that they were starting when they were just a toilet .
the teachers that we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they say what we should do .
there &apos;s about 170 tutors on the book , and so this is working beautifully .
and right behind -- there &apos;s normally a little chain -- just swimming in the way that they were teaching .
there &apos;s also this <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in <unk> , but it opens slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s bringing his grandmother .
he writes an email , he &apos;ll ask you any question you can imagine .
i was this girl .
80 percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that the peace means the end of the clash is to say , and there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace means the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one that &apos;s called the manual for entire armor , &quot; did it know ?
on the cape one , there &apos;s <unk> roads , and we all can drive here .
this is my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt badly felt bad .
so i was introduced this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos very good <unk> are .
and the most difficult thing is , so , is number 10 to be difficult .
all of the strange <unk> of <unk> , which is just about a window , and the moment that the road was just in front of my house and the white <unk> <unk> was there in the sun .
and i was going through the great presentation of karen armstrong , of course , that religion really understood the fact that they really understood , but to do with behavior .
the <unk> , geographically , geographically , the same size , it &apos;s not that it &apos;s the same size , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> of an area that &apos;s about the same size of the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have through the assumption of this challenge .
so before i show you a few images to the bow , i want to point out to this beautiful detail of <unk> and design .
rca , in this regard , is really an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve been discussing with keith haring <unk> that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their lectures , from fear to be seen as a <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s examples of this that you can actually do in 3d print , which is very interesting .
so that &apos;s what makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge of the challenge of that as a physicist .
we can press it up . the powers make more of them . there are more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; <unk> 7 : a whole band . &quot;
and there are some people in foundations called <unk> .
the idea of justice , which is the rest of our lives and gives us a sense of what &apos;s happening in life , what is the life in life , social justice .
and like this , he <unk> during the <unk> .
so every week , the <unk> would come back . &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , a infection or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> , like that .
we treat them with <unk> drugs -- the <unk> , frankly , in this kind of pain , is not very effective .
now , you get this kind of impression of how much rock we are talking here .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s nothing . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the back of you , these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which one is a part of a comet <unk> with a part of the core of a comet .
these are wise guys -- men and women -- astronauts like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and we can vote for us to vote and do it , and so we can change our future .
at that time i &apos;ve been <unk> , the only independent , to be precise , the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that <unk> would survive and a great company , if the <unk> was going to be gone , what was right .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you will never see your money again , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re meeting ourselves , you &apos;re going to take your business plan to do what you actually do .
you see , we went in east and <unk> with our work and we went to russia .
after a while we opened a little bit of a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of creating a job , to build on the free press .
and in this way , you organize the funding , so that there is no <unk> , no more blind , that running around to find .
so , why does that work so that ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some of the call that a theory of everything .
just example , this is newton , the law of gravity , which works like a divided by the square of the <unk> between the other <unk> objects .
the more symmetry you have , the better you put simplicity and elegance in theory .
one thing that he thought was most of us as given , but at its time , it was not obvious .
it doesn &apos;t seem to know the importance of this fan to know that they follow <unk> and <unk> .
but he was reading every free moment he had , books .
from this ambition , he returned to the <unk> .
but when he was just sitting in the <unk> , his signature under his signature , his hand was missing and was <unk> , because he &apos;d shake a thousand hands during a <unk> .
not very surprising -- it was just three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , ever older i get to understand what was an amazing privilege , with this aging lions of a man that many hours .
and as lincoln was told , was the story , went to the war to the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason for that is that i &apos;m always appreciative to this weird love to the story that allows me to spend a life in the back of time .
he had the temples , <unk> and <unk> .
this is the most <unk> , this object , the evidence that the jews after babylon were in babylon , after the entire years they were sitting in babylon and sat in babylon , and i was reading jerusalem that these jews were able to go home .
all of these are being rejected by cyrus .
the <unk> cylinder is written by the <unk> of the great <unk> of babylon , marduk .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people had lived in tehran in the iran .
some knowledge more about the living in the lives , but they still think they &apos;re a bad problem .
new york babies spent in the first few hours , but their needs were not allowed to be more criteria , they were not to go to try and not to try and start in the air , and they start to start to go in the air as all other .
one study shows that 10 percent of a <unk> cost , whereas <unk> costs about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me because i almost spent my whole life in front of a camera .
you know , you know , you know , what you have to do to find a reply .
it was <unk> people , most of them friends and family .
we listened to each one .
but of course , he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was excited that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , they made the unicef .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed to peace and on his options , etc . , and they &apos;re actually going to be able to do it .
we connect with <unk> -- i &apos;ve met <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; at the 2012 2012 , it &apos;s about the date .
it &apos;s about your <unk> , to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should be cognitively .
i <unk> the literature after the origin of this number , but i couldn &apos;t find them .
it &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , the exactly thing that our ancestors would invented a year of a million years ago when they found cooking cooking .
quite simple , simple ways for the <unk> conversations that i did .
and i think i &apos;m just beginning to get .
but once the fighting fought the <unk> , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to .
behind him was a child , son , red in the face of effort , to shove his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
i was talking to my ceo in the headquarters , and i told them -- i &apos;m going to <unk> -- i told them , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting with a few hours a day , just for some of the repairs . &quot;
two groups of <unk> started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it going on ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we have to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but also in the homes of people .
and you should see me as a <unk> .
and this hospital could have been able to do that <unk> .
why ? because the way i had to do was banned .
but i learned something more <unk> than that , which is that the leader -- the manager of the economy -- incredibly bad decisions that our economy had to just put in the collapse .
because i knew that the state of african continent is going to be important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to try the experience i had to have struggled to africa .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from which a great society within a generation can rise .
you &apos;ll note that he &apos;s very similar to the <unk> yellow ball -- the sun we draw as children .
in fact , this is something that &apos;s half of them , more than half , not being trusted .
32 balls <unk> .
i guess . &quot;
and these are the messages that you convey to them ?
because , in fact , the sponsors love it , and so it keeps constantly on tv .
a professional <unk> , who speaks to dead people , they don &apos;t get me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to have liked to see some people from you , like <unk> , <unk> and community <unk> , so they &apos;re contacted a little bit .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often just about a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but so the user can control whether it &apos;s power or not , because you can control the <unk> on the ground , much of how much percent oxygen you give you .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and <unk> device that we can have to hospitals .
the different kinds of writing in africa , the first one was <unk> , like the writing <unk> , which is a secret society of the <unk> society in <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , when a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , found that in 1800 in the 1900s a.d. , centuries ago , <unk> centuries .
almost one fifth of the greenhouse gases is from the <unk> -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and they <unk> and making animals on the line like tools , not just so that .
<unk> was a purely french issue .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;ll ask you a question .
some of us would argue that maybe that might not be so bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no ? &quot;
and the weekends you have the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and get all the names , even though it &apos;s still mistake .
it &apos;s been distracted . he &apos;s got the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it &apos;s been interested in interest , more about it , when the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very depressing area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a big piece of art .
human nature would change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have an ethical level in the pursuit of the -- is that they are also intrinsically valuable .
it could be more complicated in humans , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> to play with this forces ?
and so i knew i need something to use .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think you can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take pizza , our first pizza , and <unk> the individual slices , as the messenger of the hallway and we &apos;re <unk> .
i was certainly 20 , before i was going to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria as you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop work .
they were interested in creating alternative forms , and they needed money , so they decided to do some of the interesting ones of projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave , and made this , it was hilarious -- the awareness we got .
and they describes how the <unk> -- all you say is like <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it depends on origami . so , go .
people used to understand mathematical principles based on the underlying <unk> .
or they take it down to the top and make 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules with which you stack circles , you covered the <unk> with the lines , the added of the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do lots of things .
but , if you want to do it bigger , you could need something origami .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington with too much more left time .
we &apos;ve only got three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about hours hours for hours .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t realize it , this is very painful .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the chart -- it starts in 1973 , just before women start to <unk> the goods , and it goes on to the current day .
you were <unk> up .
because i &apos;m going to write a book about all this , i &apos;m still making it , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was really disheartening for them .
since we don &apos;t fully fully <unk> this information , come back to us in the form of culture , in these weird and some kind of a kind of <unk> way , where you can see that <unk> change .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who &apos;s in the middle and the way to have the cable is to fertilize the cable .
whereas the personal income income on a scale that has been constant , to take into account the inflation , in that time , has doubled down to the time .
and to hear me and understand what i &apos;m saying , you know , about 60 bits per second .
and then , in the last book of me , it &apos;s going to be a good business , so in the last book of me , &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some of their surroundings to very successful and at the same time , in very much , much ethically ethically <unk> , with great social sense .
control is always a safe thing , because you feel that you &apos;re probably , but not being very <unk> .
&quot; where are you born , grew and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own sense of what home is , they had their sense of community , and even for hostility , which was taken to you from birth , they weren &apos;t really the ability to go beyond that .
more and more people are equally as in the future or the present , as in the past .
i went down into the room i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where &apos;s home ?
there was a huge gap between the one billion in the developed world and two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world that we have today . no gap anymore .
and let me show you why i &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , digital technology .
the children of the children is the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; you know , you know , you know , &quot; your brits and your mortality rate is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with <unk> , made them grow , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice who couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be very good at the equator in summer .
i &apos;m sure many progress , many <unk> lives .
this is actually real photography , time lapse , the time lapse , the time lapse , the time you get to warm up to you .
and here on the right , you see what six months later , the technically , <unk> .
a <unk> is made of two different cell types .
we then put it back into this apocalyptic .
there &apos;s still much more complex organs , and with a distance , the most complex solid organs are the high <unk> , with every amount of <unk> <unk> organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not being frightened and not make tumors .
we need five seconds .
there &apos;s a problem in the end of any problem .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to panic at a moment -- unlike all the <unk> and sugar , which i had -- but this is an entrepreneur really miserable .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you have to go to a <unk> visit .
i went to door to door and sold <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s an opportunity .
and you would do that chairs .
that &apos;s pointless . &quot; you have to find a way to get faster and to make money faster .
i sold lots of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the ability to find other tasks , and they learn to find other tasks , and they also learn the ability to find more ways .
if you go into a restaurant and get a bad job , you show you how bad buttermilk looked like .
these young , <unk> .
the evolution of today &apos;s students is to throw all the interests from the board .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> <unk> of cultural <unk> , and the most of the students .
the values of the past are also <unk> . that &apos;s a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should be wondering when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s , we &apos;re going to go to the church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and this isn &apos;t just a different result , it has the potential to change how we interact with each other .
it &apos;s totally different .
in fact , this is not a rights organization , but it &apos;s clear -- let me finish this -- creative commons offers a simple way to give her content to the liberties of the freedom that you want to leave you with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often it &apos;s happening .
he told me that he was <unk> the <unk> and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to immerse ourselves now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to run it through this process and show you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general beats was happy .
i survived , just so we understand ourselves .
i &apos;m always asked by people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of how microbes is spread from people . architects , spaces like to have been together to promote human interaction , to promote the human interaction or the exchange of ideas in such a decade and office .
imagine design that takes the microbes for , for example , on the airplane or on a telephone .
and no one knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the <unk> .
and greenpeace was going to do this , and a method that you wanted to do that was to do that , was it in this <unk> <unk> .
at 78 percent of the voices , to give you a sense of the <unk> victory , the <unk> 2 in the <unk> was only three percent .
and the last message i want to share is : you can be pretty successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a privilege it is to stand today today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something we have in gando , are <unk> .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a great way to get the <unk> predict to make today that the science is going to be in .
it &apos;s the color red and the color black , they &apos;re standing for the constant change from day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good piece .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t have a country like china , not a civilization-state , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason for that , first , the state in china gets a very special -- great , a very special discipline , as the representative of the <unk> , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was in &apos; 72 miles long , connected beijing to the beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- the position of the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or the <unk> .
it goes on the railroad , and it goes down on the border , and the cars drive below .
red is the <unk> blue = green = black = purple is the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second was to chinese .
she agreed to her song .
i took a graffiti , my name everywhere , was used to the city as a canvas .
i mean , that &apos;s the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image was going to be another person in the face .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a <unk> face of your face -- a kind of a bicycle headed , right ?
most of the places i went , i decided to go because i &apos;ve heard about her in media .
i took more pictures , and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were paid , they were <unk> , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there &apos;s layers of layers behind each photograph .
but they &apos;ve basically taken me a promise to me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the network , and what you &apos;re driving is , why it &apos;s happening now , i think there &apos;s some factors that i want to give you as a <unk> .
you &apos;ve got an implication .
zipcar started a decade ago , in 2000 .
it challenges in participation . cities have to be welcomed by participation .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
that would be a significant <unk> caused by this .
it &apos;s vital that at ted <unk> ideas , ideas that we &apos;re thinking about , after the beginning , are we down and <unk> and make sure that this is a particularly historic century , and not one of <unk> and <unk> .
my home family is boring academics that are concerned with <unk> from <unk> to our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was mad , but something really stuck with it .
i sat there , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra , my career , has been a lot of success .
i started exploring the <unk> of the human mind .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very honored to be here at ted 2006 , and actually , they &apos;re very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you &apos;ve got the problem , you know ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents found this important for their inner <unk> .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s things apart from which i &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> .
the body has higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and this will be very far to get .
i asked him what that means .
and then , at that point , you can , if you want to learn , and you have to take a lot of languages , and you &apos;re making it <unk> for each other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , it &apos;s better . &quot;
i think you agree that they &apos;re very good .
and so far , tests of the time , with 50,000 students , they did , about , a half of a dozen school , my readers , by the way .
we found -- and we were wrong with quite lots of things , and then we kept it , but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a little primer on the <unk>
and finally , the only person , the emerging step , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with <unk> .
goliath is mild prey . it &apos;s no chance .
so goliath is bigger than the <unk> of the time , and normally there &apos;s an explanation for it , if somebody is so far outside the norm .
and i think there &apos;s a very important lesson for us to do it .
and it turns out that we are covered in a <unk> , and these microbes do usually , rather than murder .
they &apos;ve used all the microbes in the recipient and then they used the charges in the recipient .
most pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , they have one or two , maybe five species , and human community has thousands and thousands of species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that live in and on people so that we can understand what they do to our lives .
very many people think about the internet , it &apos;s a very good thing , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
when you saw it a little bit silly changes of what i thought , you thought it was all rubbish .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .
and we &apos;ve got over 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough enough for the beginning .
and i always say to say that she &apos;s also the only person that actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , that &apos;s why ...
it seems to me as though , most of the textbooks that are used to be used to education of our children , from nature .
in the jungle of guatemala , in <unk> , there &apos;s a temples .
not a well-known <unk> indian in <unk> , told a missionary in <unk> , and here it is .
it &apos;s far far under your cognitive <unk> .
we found activity in other <unk> , in <unk> , who are associated with the computation of profit and loss .
i have a friend who &apos;s just <unk> out a terrible world .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other , and we think we look at our looking &apos; &quot; and we &apos;re talking .
they were like , the knife , knife , <unk> or <unk> , which i had in a towel .
i &apos;ve been searching for long and wide , but never looked for me .
in some of these <unk> , they put tools , like sponges and <unk> .
dolphins can go and take a <unk> off of the distance .
look how you &apos;re going to synchronize with your mate and the other <unk> .
we found quickly that , the dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a boat at a keyboard .
this dolphin called &quot; <unk> &quot; because it &apos;s about 12 <unk> <unk> .
but while we decode their natural sounds , we also plan to bring this back to the global system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you have to fly the feeling .
yr : i &apos;m just trying to fit mentally .
i &apos;ve never been using the last 15 years , and i never used this wings on the beginning .
we don &apos;t have to say that their employer .
but it was up to <unk> and full of <unk> .
so , as i guess you saw what you saw , to explain what you were doing .
because this event was the scientific revolution , since the knowledge of our knowledge of physical world , and how we can adapt to our needs to our needs , <unk> in the scale .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
your wired is <unk> ; our bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a <unk> story .
and just when an explanation is good , it &apos;s also important that you can check it .
glasses aren &apos;t very expensive . they &apos;re pretty abundant .
it &apos;s currently used about 30,000 from them .
what is minto ?
the new festival challenge the audience to the viewer to a key role in the creation of performance .
she had met with others , &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant &quot; and that &apos;s done all this . &quot;
&quot; no <unk> , that &apos;s good . &quot; first doctor : &quot; is you get yourself ? &quot;
i thought my career was over .
this is a bear i was sitting around the rock .
this is a piece of <unk> ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you today images from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and leopard seals , but this painting here is more than any other i &apos;ve ever done .
people said , &quot; we knew they &apos;re sinister . we knew it . &quot;
and that seal took the penguin in the head and he kept shaking him and forth .
it swam away , it started a penguin .
she was trying to <unk> my camera , which is the dream of every photographer .
paul <unk> : stories from a <unk> <unk>
open your eyes .
do you have a ring ?
you &apos;re going to focus on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing this now , until you <unk> it .
funny , yeah , we have a little man , a <unk> , working on the top of the day .
as i said , it shapes its reality .
first of all , we were working together and developing it .
a call in the united states , in canada , or china costs five <unk> , or <unk> american dollars .
it &apos;s built up <unk> , so you can also hook a <unk> and also <unk> on some remote places .
with the time , buildings became more and greater , so that the mechanical systems were enormous , they need large amounts of energy .
imagine , you know , two americans are going to go through in italy .
please raise your hand now as you have liberal .
the best definition of <unk> i know -- she explains this much -- is coming from <unk> gary marcus .
he makes us very , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines of the world .
aren &apos;t that just the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
it went upward and further .
and they say , &quot; hold of your laws from my body . &quot;
and we have the sign of <unk> to the right , <unk> is the liberal god -- and both work together .
and so the answer , i think , is to use this passionate commitment to truth and try and turn them into a better future for us all .
but if you &apos;re reacting , a lot of other people in the environment are innocent , but also being hurt -- the military don &apos;t want to talk about <unk> .
we look at something else , &quot; and realized that the situations were actually very similar .
is someone a commandment , as often , if you think about how it was introduced , how often the police in queensland spray in the room ?
there were only a few people who were shot in this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the most primitive way of dealing with it .
and if you were to use them , people will give back to people , but they shouldn &apos;t cause any more effective damage . &quot;
we &apos;ve started organizing a maker to organize our maker <unk> .
<unk> , or billy bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved here to other people who did the same thing as he did .
this is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we need to bring this into schools , or in the communities many , many ways -- the ability to make the world to shape ourselves and new .
there &apos;s glamour in physics .
and indeed , we see these <unk> pictures of stars all the time -- they called <unk> .
it &apos;s not about a path , but you have to imagine your world .
so , stairs , they &apos;re walking from a <unk> , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always going to tell you that if you buy this light , you &apos;re going to live in a world without cords .
the perfect <unk> -- symbolizes by the perfect chain , with the perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be very <unk> and <unk> .
but i also knew how hard she did for the entire week .
i did this like a few strangers .
i heard about women who were <unk> in their homes , or <unk> in their dorm rooms , like dead left to parking lots of acid in their own .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my friend was doing this big bowl , and i asked her , &quot; what is that ? &quot;
it was <unk> friends and a loving sister .
because we all are so bad <unk> , to imagine the inner experience of our human beings , and their secret intentions . &quot;
kids need a long time to put the system .
rs : <unk> . now , joshua go to drink something like that .
rs : should ivan get this ?
and you have it in the coffee of your friend .
first of all , i &apos;m going to prove to you that it &apos;s a <unk> .
please tell me that they don &apos;t <unk> , if , say , the pentagon calls it .
but why do you feel anything ?
and it was , you know , you know , a course of <unk> .
and secondly , is it possible , or even more <unk> , to slow down ?
you want to get back to you very quick .
and norway , sweden , sweden , denmark and finland under the six <unk> nations in the world and working hours where the average american would cry of harm .
but the new idea , the revolutionary idea of <unk> is that it &apos;s also something like &quot; good slow down . &quot;
i &apos;m sure that <unk> like a <unk> job on my <unk> , and it was <unk> me to tell you , because they were so slowly , and i wanted to be ready to finish .
and so it all took his beginning , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build anything like an island ; part of it has to stay on the shore because we want to avert the community . &quot;
i was working months and i didn &apos;t work with it , because i felt that people who came from the historical museum already had information , and i was getting full of the museum with information , and if you can see a museum with information , they wouldn &apos;t be able to digest it .
when i went back home , the <unk> was planned .
but you can see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe safdie : this is the way of the uniqueness of hopelessness .
and if christian played a note -- play for example .
so , in jazz , the <unk> is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about my vision , or something like that .
am i interested ? exist ? i exist ?
they had to come up with a lot of <unk> to come here .
the summer is china , it becomes extremely hot .
and the adult animal that comes after that is still a decade or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it today . these are hundreds of <unk> .
i &apos;m going to do a little bit curious . i &apos;m going to say you , because i &apos;m a lot of people who have spent their childhood here .
so , next , i was going to get my phone .
october , november , november , december , it &apos;s not the southwest monsoon .
okay , they put their eggs at the time of the <unk> , and during the permafrost .
last week , it &apos;s got <unk> . the <unk> have begun , and now it &apos;s raining .
quite incredible <unk> .
incredible . this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> at all . it &apos;s pretty unbelievable .
i made this from my life .
and everybody thought i was good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , it &apos;s -- oh , what happened with <unk> ? &quot;
the night before i was looking at the night , i looked at them and asked me , &quot; how am i going to do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , you know , these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all this , what is it , that &apos;s driving one , and then i &apos;ve told about the <unk> and other things , but what does it take ?
my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really cracked the code .
whenever the bombsight get into an airplane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of <unk> guards .
the plant plant plant water <unk> over three square miles .
after the war was over , there was a <unk> -- as it was the army that would always be doing -- and they asked the question : how many <unk> did we actually have destroyed ?
i described to you the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or a <unk> , that &apos;s the diversity of human species in an amazing way .
we &apos;re asking questions about human ancestry .
but what data is based on the subject ?
imagine that you have to <unk> .
it was a african , on which the world &apos;s diversity is based on .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
the people who were <unk> to kill the animals that were <unk> , they went to the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , about about 12,000 years from the <unk> phase of the sahara .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe is not moving from its shifting to complexity .
so there we go .
what you see here is the blue areas are about a one-thousandth of light , cooler than the red areas .
and they &apos;re getting over smaller distances as gravity , which explains why it and i are smaller than stars and planets .
you &apos;re being familiar with the double nature of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you &apos;re asking , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not as good if it &apos;s about <unk> .
and then you have to decide how you invest in your 52 choices and you &apos;ve never heard about a <unk> .
at least a wonderful study has predicted .
but if you get the license , you get the boxes to the box if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken away .
save more tomorrow , it just makes it .
this is just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a call <unk> , a creature that makes a creature that looks like a creature .
hi , who &apos;s because , please ?
thank you .
knowledge has too much influence on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did you do ? she sent her walter , and then they &apos;re going to split their human portion of the <unk> of the divine part .
do you <unk> a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> <unk> ! <unk> ! !
i went to visit a friend of mine and he &apos;d wait for his <unk> hill in the 20th hill , in the 20th floor , a really rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we &apos;ve lived less than a dollar a day -- about 15 years .
and you have to use nuts from the rainforests that you have to use that forest forests as forests are worth of the forest as a forest . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t have a person who &apos;s going to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if you should all be sustainable in a finite planet , how can we get to this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end , i think 60 percent of the world &apos;s worldwide , and 25 percent of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy the carbon in the trees , to get the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the product to europe .
so the communication is being cut between brain and spinal cord , and this leads to a complete and sustained paralysis paralysis .
after a few years , we &apos;ve managed to develop a <unk> <unk> that is the nervous system of the spinal cord in a <unk> state .
we &apos;ve been working hard enough to achieve this goal .
after a few weeks , we put a programmable pump to inject a programmable pump to inject the spinal cord .
and i was a kid of the working working .
he was talking about the world , as it is &quot; and &quot; world &quot; as it is supposed to be . &quot;
and by doing that , they <unk> these women , lots of obstacles .
the white house , and the joy he &apos;s sitting on it is called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the last day , the woman came over the day , who were there all of us , and we talked about a short story , and suddenly she said , &quot; would you sing anything ? &quot;
for this , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely <unk> , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs <unk> and instructions .
one of the most favorite websites in the world , which is run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing to do , or google , to have .
and today , wikipedia is so <unk> that you can actually find the cards of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s what wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
the world ended up not in the 90s .
and we see that the impact of the sphere in the field is very , very strong .
all this costs money .
and it was taken a lot to talk to students with <unk> or social weak families to give the same opportunity .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in high-performing applications , teachers are going to go alone and have a lot of <unk> .
some people argue that the change of the <unk> is a lot of a <unk> .
but if you look at the problem from this perspective , you see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i was walking around the morning about 15 kilometers to get to the <unk> .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could also do that with phones .
so a business creates for you .
&quot; the government has to provide economically conducive to services . &quot;
once once , a long time ago , when i was 24 years old , i was studying st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my card when i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m going to bring an invention to do with .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see japan is going through a period of war , with low life expectancy .
and they decided not only to invest in health and education , but they also started investing in the economy .
washington , d.c. , went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble in the bubble .
will they really get a fully fully global economy , and the power power agency , where they were in the last 50 to 150 years , then back to asia ?
the rest of the graph is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that &apos;s also the only thing that &apos;s not about the mass of the mass .
and you &apos;ll notice the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on during the <unk> .
they move away from each other , because the room is bigger .
by looking like clusters of galaxies -- their <unk> , how many of you have a function of time -- can we get into experience , in which way , in the way , is to be able to look into structures in the periodic way .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy man banjo boys : <unk> bluegrass from ... new jersey ?
so , recycling and reusing are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : a <unk> of reasons to reinvent the <unk> <unk> .
and in fact , this change was in gay men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and many children .
in uganda we see the prevalence took a thousand .
so that &apos;s pretty similar to close .
but openness and connection has a prize if we think about disease , this should not be a surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> studies the aids of africa at the same time to come from an economic perspective , and then a surprising conclusion : all of our knowledge that &apos;s the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this kind of <unk> <unk> colored <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; because he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , but every time he went into a tunnel , he built a <unk> , and the <unk> out of the tunnel , there was always a kind of <unk> .
this <unk> fits into the water like a magnet .
then we ask ourselves , why is the membrane of the way that &apos;s <unk> and why that &apos;s going to use so much power .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> in a material .
<unk> <unk> , my <unk> , we &apos;re working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry &apos;s use biomimicry
&quot; yeah , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , no boys .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because that &apos;s now , and never again .
they said , &quot; yeah . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s ask you . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we did for a few years later , a kind of development of a captcha .
basically , you do it by just starting with a old book .
the number of sites that are actually using recaptcha is so high that the number of words we &apos;re putting in a daily basis is very big .
some are more fun .
at the time , the web is divided in several languages .
then my favorite idea of the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a rock .
but what perhaps even more surprising is that the translations we get from the <unk> , even if you &apos;re just <unk> the translations we are as much as the ones that are , as professional <unk> , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people have value as they learn to do their own , they don &apos;t pay for money , they pay for their time .
the <unk> site , the company , does what they really can do .
<unk> <unk> to active active is all different than normal .
and zipcar gives a very common , <unk> service that works fabulous .
for aristotle , it was very good for aristotle , the goal , to all of that .
maybe these people are right . they &apos;re not good thought of it , maybe not good .
ten percent of the time , the thoughts goes ... -- in sex .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
now , from the first <unk> , no explicit <unk> out of the -- so no one had the absolute majority -- so no one round up the election -- so no one round three weeks later .
now , here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i went to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
the people in the 17th century , not really , as we did , that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re going to be <unk> out of a specific reason and so .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to ask for the available to give you a building , and you can meet you there , but speaking there is not there please .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody was a little understood that way .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i have something that i &apos;m not personally .
if you want to become rich today , entrepreneurs will .
you say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go -- it doesn &apos;t go -- you don &apos;t get up at all . we &apos;ve been doing very carefully from satellites , and it &apos;s not increasing .
biochemist mullis talks about the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and <unk> the curiosity , inspiration , and care science in all of their forms .
i wanted a very simple body , which is that these <unk> , <unk> spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a nickname of new york and &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which is coming from the feeling of the <unk> in an urban environment .
i love traveling , and berlin is one of my <unk> .
and the whole time i &apos;ve gone across , i don &apos;t have a single rat in some of these places , until recently , when i was walking in the london in london .
the first question is , and maybe they &apos;re going to write them on a sheet of paper , physically , or a virtual piece in your head , and , for a while , they can try and try this .
and we then stop , &quot; we are the best <unk> in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you &apos;re going to lose -- well , in your <unk> , you thought , &quot; well , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult things is , if people have already been a glimpse of how it works , it &apos;s pretty hard to change .
and when an expert for <unk> chemistry have been friends and colleagues , the different between the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , it <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s growing in a way .
we even have amazing forms of life that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a letter to a colleague of the guess that life has probably been going on , somewhere in a warm pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of really big <unk> molecules in the same size of dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not a carbon in the field .
we want to put it into the environment , and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and matter to make matter of matter , then , then , it &apos;s actually defining life .
but there &apos;s a second reason , but why i like this <unk> : every single one is measuring .
and these are the professional women interviewer who sat down an hour with a woman and asking them to their <unk> questions .
i was really sitting on friday , i was able to see my computer , and i could see the <unk> of <unk> in the morning .
as you know , i love these economists , they want to keep the money , more and more of it .
as you can see , it makes no sense to measure an average of a improvement that has no one , and that very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about that much .
in which they have high , or very high , child mortality and the families were also very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s the other thing .
whatever remains is worth of money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; well , the <unk> in question .
the entire time was a border .
and <unk> , in my opinion , the world will make a difference , not just for a few few , but for everybody .
above the knee , yeah , that &apos;s hard ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody needs , but not everybody &apos;s needs .
and <unk> are dying .
i went to high school .
when i was at the head of scientific <unk> research -- 40 laboratories -- if two <unk> don &apos;t talk each other , i built teams .
they &apos;re built on this , and now i have apps in the pirate store .
it &apos;s about perfect and something that was the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but it &apos;s not more <unk> .
because this reactor isn &apos;t under a pressure , and it &apos;s not a <unk> , meaning that the <unk> seatbelts are not tend to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is designed to be a innovative source of power , the great scientific projects that &apos;s electricity to do with electricity , and i &apos;m really willing to do this .
we move to a <unk> where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the <unk> that we have to run in the woods .
and finally , the end of a long <unk> good piece he says , he says , &quot; especially , you know , <unk> against you .
normally , you don &apos;t go far in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot out in this city .
and then they &apos;re going to be as wrong as a <unk> -- by using qualities that they don &apos;t have .
when i was a little bit , i was very introverted and i &apos;d like to just go for me .
then it &apos;s just about to start to start to start to start to build it to the end of the <unk> .
so i built it from concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , the most important thing , because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
twenty-five days : the <unk> is developed by 32 days : arms and hands are developing , for 36 days : the primitive flight starts to train in the <unk> train , and the <unk> is developing the fastest .
the complexity , this is a single system , again , in fact , is beyond any understanding of any understanding , or any of all today .
because apparently , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> , not in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these puzzles ?
recently , a colleague of berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting range and asked , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways of <unk> and <unk> stars -- to which matter and chemical elements are produced in the universe .
because can you imagine everything <unk> ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something we cannot explain and we &apos;re just sitting on and say , &quot; we &apos;re going to give up . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see <unk> , and oxygen , then i think we have the perfect world .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he goes , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you : it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly addicted to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a small breakdown -- -- it was actually more like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what are the feeling of being vulnerable ? &quot;
i have right , you don &apos;t right . stop .
we do , as if what we do , no effect on other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , to try to use some systematic improvements , then we think about how to be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and self-awareness .
and today , i want to talk about one of the things we decided to do , then we wanted to find a new access to health .
steven &apos;s got his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people praying .
i love this <unk> implant , also , these were the only ones that were online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any <unk> , you don &apos;t have data , that &apos;s not scientific methods .
this is the curve of the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t , with him , he was going to end .
if we went from here to the <unk> , we would push on a little , which is 300 meters tall , <unk> miles long , 28 miles wide and that &apos;s two gigatons .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s called the <unk> .
these are the networks of complex systems are very beneficial .
and it has also implications for systemic systemic risk .
so we could put together in every single <unk> .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that focus on to understand our wired world from the point of view of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- except you use expensive pumps and the valves .
and we &apos;ve prepared 500 of these <unk> .
without human <unk> .
so we were on our <unk> .
and this graph is not even something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts very quickly to think that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> into the public in the world .
because this question is , our external world can predict the way that we can predict , the truth , but that &apos;s only 10 percent of the <unk> of the <unk> person to be able to predict if i &apos;m going to <unk> the entire world .
and this is a very <unk> scientifically , and i &apos;m wrong .
we are moving people to write a <unk> , a positive email , a positive email or to <unk> to someone in their social environment .
weightfully to say -- a <unk> , you understand , my father was the most <unk> man in the world .
so i went . i went to mit , started .
they said , make it stop .
you take a huge disk of cardboard .
he was the first digital media in tokyo .
listen ? like this ? how cows ? this is in a <unk> 4 a.m.
so there &apos;s all these things to do , but most of the love i love to learn about the world .
and i &apos;m going to do this with passion .
their culture is not in schools . and i want to see ways of looking for this problem as we can overcome this problem .
so that makes them so nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to school , which there is no boys .
and most moments in my life .
or mothers who raised the young ?
we need to change attitudes to girls in elementary school .
and you have the idea that you think that would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that , &quot; why &quot; <unk> evidence can be the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do this , and i &apos;m also so excited if it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really affect any human .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s <unk> with my ipad , and this is a software that runs on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i &apos;m going to put them around a <unk> , so that people react to the glass if you &apos;re coming to them .
i &apos;m going to be turned into a middle-aged man , and then , in a old man .
they &apos;re just allowed to use .
radio : what do you think ?
fold the wings together and drive them on .
so i &apos;m going to ask you a different question .
and he made a <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , who used to <unk> , and night , but with the secret instructions , it doesn &apos;t really good instructions .
because they found that <unk> are more powerful .
yet , we have to create a very clear <unk> , where you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of scrutiny .
now , if we &apos;ve all available these tools , we have to just have to ask ourselves the question -- and thaler and <unk> have done this -- how we use these more intelligent .
they lead the new <unk> .
they give them little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt passion , passion , soul and heart had left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , <unk> <unk> , makes a different replicator in this <unk> of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than space for you all .
we are the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hey .
they use us to produce more and more computers , and more amazing things that we &apos;re hearing about here at ted .
and will we go through this third of the problem , and we &apos;re going to have the second run by the second ?
working with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the ministry of public health services , with various <unk> , engineers more than 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t be a lot of cost if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had a 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .
we also found that well , it would have been good to recover me and then gave me the <unk> of the pain .
how bad would be the sentence if i would get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the smartest people -- the <unk> people -- who have more <unk> -- less <unk> , and that less religious -- those who couldn &apos;t remember anything that could be <unk> .
so if you don &apos;t get a brand for a few seconds , you think you get a brand , does that make a difference ?
that &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces have very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i &apos;m working in the commercial .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon will be defined by the brand and the <unk> , defined how they want to spend their money , what &apos;s money and what makes it .
maybe it seems to be a big leap ?
i don &apos;t have to keep the audience to keep this , and i &apos;ve had to explain it , i had to explain it to my first , and these are these structures that sperm sperm from an individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> here , or even most of the animals , they don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by using them over bone .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton we found to the natural world , which had the same <unk> .
all of the ones i showed this was really surprised .
a funny song about global warming , from jill sobule .
well , i &apos;m going to have to be right now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a play ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> , are the benefits of great education .
the <unk> <unk> totally made of it , and then , was going to be ben became a <unk> .
so on , it &apos;s what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home to leave the democratic republic of the congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> has gone the <unk> of the united nations , the wealth of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they need to be very inexpensive to their disposal .
but could not be done for this angle of <unk> ?
they were supportive of governments , and in many cases they also get them .
but suppose we &apos;re going to be able to take new economic action to bring the base of the pyramid .
because they need a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their gains .
he liked it on her lap because he said that it was painful to be painful for him in his own bed .
since in the midst of the country , when sir <unk> <unk> and the british society of <unk> , the sun shines .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something more .
and this energy is it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s about traditional blood pressure .
we have to make it a power power .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a big impact .
in fact , most of all the countries that were to do , but they were all the population that the population <unk> in the last month , their opinion was stated to a foreign officials -- only four percent .
but the expectations of people are getting worse for their future .
so the question is , &quot; what is the ability to get the male support for women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you , she &apos;s read the news .
no one can listen to you , you &apos;re just sending them quiet .
you could see the immediate effects of the laws or the <unk> talk to a <unk> , and see what happens as a result .
it took 12 seconds and went over 35 feet .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
from the smallest <unk> , the sheer powers of the storms of nature .
we can do it as individuals , and give us their ears .
we think somebody else is going to <unk> , somebody <unk> , somebody with more means that this problem is going to solve .
we didn &apos;t go into it in the pacific .
it took a full full prototypes , until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s a side of this incredible <unk> , which is possible , and this is a very serious serious thing that means .
and think about our moral .
and the director of the director was quite passionate , and i told me that he was going to be crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are severe offenders .
it took several such events until i found out what i should do .
when i started this program four years ago , my <unk> plan was to create a <unk> <unk> .
and they go down to <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and fortunate that i had the audacity to give up to nyu , and to return to my home home country , where i was doing this incredible trip with this group of <unk> children from ethiopia , <unk> and russia .
and how many times would you have to die , before i understand that it didn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
well , <unk> , <unk> , this findings of my <unk> self-esteem , that feeling of otherness .
that was because i had no self , which was between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life and what &apos;s next .
and this is a cafe in the ocean cafe .
but instead of doing that , we focused on how we focused on it .
we also found that , like a <unk> structure and a <unk> way , through that structure would be .
but we found that seed -- this really important project , is actually rather than -- but that seed -- in the leading <unk> gardens , seed will not be issued .
we worked with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of the seed cathedral , so that if you &apos;re an advantage , it &apos;s kind of <unk> and soft and soft , the piece of landscape you see here .
it &apos;s just the first few windows that you &apos;re seeing and the rest is just like postcards .
the book is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaf &quot; , &quot; the popular idea , the popular idea of the human mind is a blank slate and all its texture of its <unk> , culture , education and experience .
well , there are a bunch of political reasons that they love to do well .
it &apos;s not clear that these generalizations were pointing , but then it seemed to be the <unk> <unk> .
another <unk> and <unk> at universities who are actually in <unk> in the demise of asia .
well , the other hot iron is the limb .
and i think you can &apos;t say this better .
i also call <unk> , just like <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but you confirm it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking about . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer system -- that &apos;s weird .
so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s like -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , every one of us .
their iphone , without the people , the same containment , same circuits , the same keyboard , and over again .
and then it became <unk> and <unk> and now it &apos;s <unk> for it .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you have fake yourself here ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a sane way ?
so , so all of the things that came to the <unk> , evidence of the <unk> , &quot; according to his clinician , he was going to be crazy .
he came in <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , american cities just turned into <unk> .
and i added , &quot; i &apos;ve got a list of <unk> traits in my pocket pocket .
and the first thing is always the breadth of the village of the interviewee .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend began to <unk> the rest of the world .
and as a consequence of that , we &apos;re very hard to say , is it very difficult to say , i &apos;m <unk> the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west <unk> was <unk> , and that it was the underlying democracy against communism .
and even though the president of it , for president , reasons , very well , has made islam not a enemy , there &apos;s nevertheless , a natural impulse to call the other side as an enemy .
when the bubble in 2000 were <unk> , you saw the peak of the best <unk> that scientists ever had to have the site for african penguins -- that &apos;s at this stage as endangered species .
and the day after our arrival , two of us were <unk> with the <unk> over room : space 2 had more than 4,000 left oiled penguins .
we &apos;ve been using this method in the treasure rescue .
and that &apos;s really important because the african penguin was going to be explained by a endangered species .
at the <unk> row , at the <unk> , a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police station .
people are open for the <unk> .
we launched this campaign -- very fun -- called &quot; every single egg . &quot;

these are <unk> , abstract .
hillel , then on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re going to do is do it to your neighbor &apos;s neighbors . this is the <unk> . the rest of the rest are commentary .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes him <unk> and puts it very careful about it and the two men see each other and they see each other as an divine .
this is the view of the cells that i really have drawn into biology and science , looking at the <unk> cells in the microscope .
each grain of sand has a size of a tenth of millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this image was the beginning of the <unk> .
we &apos;re all looking at the inside of the inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 of 700 of inches of salt , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s on the left , an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in an x-ray , we see all the little <unk> in the edges .
i had to <unk> the car in the middle , for you , you know , not really , really , really simple .
yeah , they gave 12 apes for a week , and after this week , they only used to be a toilet .

no , i &apos;m going to throw a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not allowed to agree on either .
not professor and <unk> , just two spirits , ready to <unk> .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacture was that there were right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
would you have time to process information ?
we &apos;ve spent a billion dollars , a billion dollar -- you hear right — you know , you know , you know , you know , a billion <unk> <unk> , where he was involved , and what we found was shocking , but then more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were struck by these shell companies were quickly taken their <unk> and the most important in london <unk> companies are very <unk> about it .
it &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re going to be all old . we &apos;re all sick . people are leaving us .
there are places you can &apos;t walk , and you don &apos;t think you can &apos;t think about worlds that you can &apos;t inhabit .
they have a <unk> and a freedom that i believe is the foundation of a new <unk> .
she made the decision to get no <unk> or <unk> , but their life that was devoted to no other girls .
we are all refugees .
but you get this thing about the head , and then something happened .
but it doesn &apos;t do that . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find this , but he was complaining , and said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go into &apos; recovery or you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
&quot; ah ! we &apos;re gathering to the <unk> beloved . let &apos;s pull out .
if it &apos;s in the box , which is the <unk> , then it forms .
the characteristics that the word <unk> are so often in the adult that we should eradicate this old <unk> word of the old <unk> word of the way , to criticize the behavior that is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
if i <unk> the ability to my sister , the 10 percent of interest that i &apos;ve been in for the last loan , i &apos;m going to have her ability to get more money from me until she paid back to it .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sound that we create people , the <unk> .
this is after forestry .
there are lots of <unk> of <unk> , among other things , how animals are taught us to dance and sing that i &apos;m going to take a different time for another time .
so that was an embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this <unk> here is 16 .
so , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the subjects that are actually going to be alive .
a generation that makes as much more meaning from video games than the real world .
all of these are problems outside my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games is for our civilization .
finally , i say ! that was it .
he would like it really well .
so , you get quickly from the simple to complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we do .
and then they <unk> them , and i thought , well , at least long time , until she &apos;s explained to me that , to think about it , to think about it , to think about it .
it &apos;s going to drive the other direction .
girl : there were a sphere and a <unk> , because there are two totally different <unk> <unk> , and if you drop them at the same time , you may drop the same time .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
and then we &apos;re going to change ourselves in the end of the world , just as we &apos;ve changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible effects .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want to be the new version .
they &apos;re too much .
they &apos;re even going to be able to do it .
i &apos;m going to be able to put his words back in the order .
&quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; strange that you &apos;re asking .
and she goes , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
and we looked at us , and i was grateful , because she was just saying . wow ! this is <unk> . &quot;
the goal of project is just simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a <unk> team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is some serious problems in the project that they should not have .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change the change , not just if a <unk> engineer was an answer .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and it &apos;s just very quickly and simple .
yeah , good , you &apos;ve got a little bit of my life , because <unk> times , of beautiful <unk> form .
no , but it &apos;s true , the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t intend to draw them up to be nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; brought me every lot of the meeting with the audience .
we &apos;ve got a lot of time for the existence of the animals on this planet than they &apos;ve been here to us , until we reach the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of these very thin <unk> over all the planet , and we had a very <unk> death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and so much else .
it &apos;s the top <unk> , it &apos;s a total of the <unk> .
they hate us .
that &apos;s when material material comes from the deep sea and the surface is spread across the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a <unk> from the coast , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
you have a crash . you have two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you take hydrogen sulfide and , you say , 75 percent of them will become saved , mentally mentally .
<unk> and <unk> .
some of you are countries that are assuming that deregulation or no governance is the best way to encourage investment to trade .
the answer is simple : the chinese are defined these factories as chemical in the brain , not as a <unk> , and check it .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to come all together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a secure environment .
now , however , we have the idea that it &apos;s the beginning of a new way of the regulation of international task .
human rights becomes a very simple question , can i give people back to this person ?
or otherwise , to find the young that the fire has taken to see if you could change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and light .
again , again , we saw the spoken word word &quot; <unk> &quot; walls . &quot;
after the fight , he would be shaking his <unk> , <unk> hair and said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see my students &apos; third step , but i had to be lucky with charlotte , that their journey is so developed as it did .
my parents have sarah called a <unk> name .
i want to talk about some ideas that have been driven by becoming a <unk> .
when i saw that the war for everybody who had such advanced consequences and that the <unk> could actually be a factor in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a <unk> .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released , the black population was the last phase of apartheid destruction of apartheid .
and the next day i made my way to rwanda , and it was like i was going to go up in the <unk> .
after the fall of <unk> in indonesia , i began to investigate the conditions of poverty in a country that was headed to the modernization of the country .
one hospital the doctors &apos; doctors without <unk> .
the <unk> is so efficient that the proportion of the soldiers that survive a <unk> , in that war is much higher than in every other in our history .
to make sure that as little as possible , we have all of these procedures to vote .
so , you select this way .
but this is a very hard subject , pretty hard subject , so i had to have a duck .
the size is the population -- this big china , this big india .
and in all eastern religions , there was the same thing .
because death of a child will be <unk> with another child .
and what is the cause of qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all of the religions in the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like all of our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
day eight .
in india alone , my <unk> best friends and i went from door to the same picture , every single house in india , and we did about a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all <unk> -- and i asked them those questions they want to ask them .
i think we owe the gphin and ron st. john &apos;s been a lot of gratitude , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- there -- he &apos;s the founder of gphin .
larry brilliant : first , they &apos;re not angry because of the injury of the copyright ?
have built a <unk> , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , to the world as a company ?
they save 85 percent of power with an led that would have used to use an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent will be difficult , and we had this conversation in the company .
a <unk> paid for herself in seven or eight years .
our 17,000 peace program in western <unk> are 47 percent of women , but this isn &apos;t enough , and we want to close this gap and make this path to the high management .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re not going to be spiritual .
this is , &quot; he said , &quot; is the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
somebody , whose attitude is that it or a sense of a sense , or a steam from the ears .
in our <unk> , we were going to see the openness of the other .
like i would go back to bangalore , and i often wondered , <unk> speaking of <unk> , as they were very upset about new <unk> , where a drink often costs more than what they paid for their 14 years of old <unk> .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said that he would try to improve the lives of his child child .
this <unk> seemed quite happy to be , and it had no deaths from complaining , even dozens of <unk> in liberia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s troubling -- not ? -- that the media media make such a bad job that a small group of activists in the situation is able to release more of this kind of information than the rest of the <unk> combined .
j yeah . this was the cover in the guardian and then it was printed around kenya around kenya , in the <unk> and the south african press .
j the effect on people who were working on it was a decade .
and there &apos;s lots of information .
i would be interested in what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious about the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you must be careful with the notion of hacker .
just a month ago , all of the <unk> parliament was <unk> .
and all of these numbers , i just do add two or three variables .
this piece here can be seen very different depending on where you &apos;re going to go .
first i read about this in a bluegrass suite at a <unk> , and the <unk> of responsible for responsible medicine and seven <unk> .
so according to this research , the best <unk> for a chicken is not to let it to just sit down , but not too long in the way it &apos;s black and a <unk> from <unk> , brown sugar or saltwater .
and then the next summer i was working under my <unk> , <unk> , texas .
and this realization is an incredibly for the efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps for many different types of cancer .
for example , exquisitely organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , care and in the workplace .
because these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable , and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for generations .
and immediately , a voice : &quot; gotcha ! &quot;
after the conference , my talk came to people , men and women .
weightfully !
a prosthesis is not for the need , a lack of it .
we &apos;re all different perspectives .
i was in the field of the beijing to try to the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these <unk> are young people , in 30 people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the banks , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> from europe and america , to be exposed .
they have a kind of tools that they can make a chicken or fish , and it looks like cattle .
people think about questions , we will continue to keep our environment towards our higher wealth ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
well , the record was not even going , so they &apos;re the first ones to see this .
mars is more than the earth , it seems to be the same <unk> .
sousa was afraid that we &apos;re going to have the opportunity to lose this , quote , &quot; <unk> &quot; -- they would take us .
but much more important , the bmi used works to create new <unk> that they use for free to their subscribers , then in the year , as a <unk> with a <unk> of hiv , the majority of the edits began to bmi .
and i ...
for the <unk> , i &apos;m trying to try and try to say , as a good , of course , a little bit of government , and a mistake , right ?
this is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
okay , i want to clear to somebody , but i just realized that the person on the right next to you is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see that fat , no . &quot;
and another study showed that strangers would lie in the first 10 minutes of their meeting .
here &apos;s a guy with her pet .
i &apos;ll say it again .
they &apos;re not going to be a lot of liars in the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , while we shake the head .
science has been brought in a lot more of more and science .
look carefully , and you &apos;ll see the <unk> smile in the whole video .
in this so much more sophisticated world , it can make us feel better for us to be more explicit in terms of our moral standards .
and that &apos;s not right , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world that we live in life , but that &apos;s not true .
so what you &apos;re talking about is a <unk> , if not tragic joke about harry , harry seems like ethnic <unk> .
six months after that , without any explanation , let me go free .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m concerned about .
when i was 10 , i &apos;ve broken the <unk> country , and i was broken .
a new song suggested that .
so i took a time to study coke &apos;s time .
and in the remote fields of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you have to have incentive based on the effects that you &apos;re doing on these places of these places ?
i don &apos;t have a pleasant <unk> like &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re waiting for being cut .
much more people would have been bitten .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first , what we &apos;ve lost , and secondly , how do we get it .
and here you can see the biggest part of the living world of florida <unk> .
if there &apos;s no fishing in a reef , because it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , then that &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , eating the sea urchins , and then they grow the algae .
you can see the border of the <unk> because there are all boats <unk> .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so the protection of the ground and the oceans has become a sink for funds of governments and <unk> facilities , and that &apos;s not <unk> .
in the coral reefs , we &apos;ve found that the pyramid of the <unk> is to be where five lions come down to a <unk> .
okay , <unk> , thank you for having a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it &apos;s been <unk> as the longest creature .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the window and look at a submersible .
and in other things , we &apos;re trying to get our partners in woods , and this virtual world -- the world , to get this endangered terrain -- to the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a <unk> . they don &apos;t have a mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in <unk> .
these worms are growing up to several inches in the week .
the concept of the <unk> is futile .
and the rest of one percent look for the formula for the formula to apply them to the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure , the <unk> , measurements , <unk> , dots , etc .
students need to be able to do this . they have to be entitled to it .
and the best , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the <unk> at the end of the <unk> .
what is it that i think is the small hadron collider ?
here you are going to find the fastest growing young population .
it &apos;s <unk> . there &apos;s no state schools in slums .
this is a computer that was installed on the entrance to your slum , by a <unk> social entrepreneur , the <unk> experiments , the <unk> experiments took that kids in certain circumstances , could learn from a computer .
now , the key is motivation , and in two things .
this is a school in a building site in pune , which is the fastest growing city of asia .
you should turn it into mcdonald &apos;s .
there &apos;s formal ability to schools , <unk> , hospitals , in which innovation can take place , and informal environments , communities , social networks .
every child to age of 15 , that would be able to have a place in a school , 2015 will be able to get a place .
and as i look at it , this scene that comes down to tears that i &apos;ve been in my own , and i &apos;ve been <unk> down for 25 years .
here &apos;s another couple of parents of teens , we need to cook for them -- and they &apos;re going to <unk> every night for two , three or four , it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s going to sit everywhere and everything !
these gay , people like me , are treated as full citizens , and it &apos;s just written on the front of our nose .
there &apos;s got to fear for their jobs , so they don &apos;t show who they really are , here &apos;s at home , and it &apos;s not just about north carolina ; all states without needing a color that &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i was scared .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
who was my grandparents ?
it helps us to become what we could have .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and actually , here &apos;s this insect .
i was standing on a person &apos;s day .
it &apos;s not <unk> down to the 43 or 44 degrees fahrenheit for about two days , but it &apos;s keeping a constant temperature .
but the contrast is going to be like this . you &apos;ll get out of the background .
here &apos;s what americans put the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me , and all the parents here are going to see the <unk> .
i have a <unk> history .
our lives are determined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create an opportunity to create an amazing interfaces that can tell the great stories .
i &apos;ve also thrown a look at the various <unk> <unk> , because you can select what you want to point out from data .
it &apos;s a <unk> man who &apos;s sitting in the box and controls this <unk> .
a <unk> of about 11 sheep an hour , which is a <unk> of <unk> cents .
and in the reason , you can do it -- what you see on the left is the <unk> , and on the right side , you see the <unk> <unk> as he was interpreted by the age of 16 people who had no idea what they do .
the bell bell : the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> ... aaron <unk> : and we took all these individual pieces and put them into another mechanical turk for request .
but we knew that we needed the right person to put them behind them and then build something .
and underneath all of the individual , people who submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made some pictures of images , cut , and then put them together in <unk> .
so , a <unk> consequence of that , you &apos;re always seeing one part of his picture , and it leads to a very free version .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti in 2010 .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers that we are made , and what we &apos;re presenting as our identity .
another <unk> is in a public library in san jose , california .
this has its own personal personality .
it &apos;s probably easier to save a good living today .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly stereotypical .
it &apos;s just too weird .
you know , in the middle of england , if you were hit , you know , you know , you know , &quot; unhappy &quot; -- literally , somebody who was lucky , the fate , not <unk> : a <unk> .
and that &apos;s going to be opening in the recent court with the angels and <unk> , and the sky will open .
i told them the plot of <unk> <unk> .
what i think i really talked about is success and failure .
we should make sure that it &apos;s our ones that we really are the <unk> of our own <unk> .
alain de : a <unk> , <unk> <unk>
if you train in this exercise , you smile don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re swimming with <unk> <unk> , and you add 60 trains a minute , so you never really look at something like that , you don &apos;t see good .
they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down on three <unk> .
they should worry about me , i didn &apos;t make me .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> that i &apos;m interested in .
this is already today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly <unk> <unk> , like today , as many of these things special <unk> , because they &apos;re not as good .
many of you have given the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our lives . we should be living by our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go from sleep now .
so we can change the medicine in the <unk> , in all ages , in all ages , from <unk> children , to the elderly ; the <unk> arena changes , the entire spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of it -- around the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the implications of the sun are enormous and the implications of disease are also enormous in all of these different diseases and more .
how do we do this stable societies ? longevity .
and in novel , a particular called an prediction is being produced . and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and destroys the whole system .
and so no <unk> .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
<unk> should be faster .
maybe you wonder how we do this <unk> .
we are the only cookbook of the world , in the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more likely to have a lot of people than doctors .
but ultimately , the accident is .
they had to give their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i &apos;ve been talking about the big , complicated robots .
and as you see , how it comes out to do something useful , it cannot remain that <unk> .
and we don &apos;t even have to have on these <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we haven &apos;t just shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic , but also that openness enabled openness to <unk> and taking the risk of risks by causing some unexpected discovery .
the film that we &apos;re going to see is they made for the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it went on . they always try to make things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s do the house . &quot;
i think in my family , we had very much lucky , because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
so , i think , very good !
ed : and then a <unk> row is a historic <unk> , and since in the <unk> history , the <unk> in paris here has taken her first where the message has been there .
see this chair ? the orange one is the <unk> <unk> . in 1940 asia .
because part of the matter of that , where we want to get .
it was <unk> of outrage , and they were full of speculation , and they were full of speculation . they were not solid information .
one of them is familiar with the population , the population of two , we went from two to seven billion people in the last 50 years .
<unk> lawson : nice to be here .
you see the lines as the population population is happening .
before i even talk about the costs , i have to realize very clear .
this is actually liberation .
but just recently , we can demonstrate to technical progress , now the <unk> and quantum locking .
first , some strands of magnetic field are trapped inside , but the superconductor don &apos;t like it when they &apos;re moving , because they use their movements , and they &apos;re so <unk> .
and of course , these round magnets can also expand to form a random rail .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , and the situation is , &quot; by hitchhiking through the galaxy . &quot;
because they don &apos;t explain how to do it , if you want to do it and not have a <unk> .
but even though they didn &apos;t believe they were saying , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot; -- never have .
<unk> : yeah , i have .
so some people say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law will come to dig its limits ? &quot;
today , they can buy half a billion , and they &apos;re better , because they &apos;re faster .
but how are we going to get the software ?
larry page : i was standing a passionate about our <unk> , where he was trying to provide this big challenges of humanity .
they wanted to catch the fish .
this may sound <unk> , but it &apos;s incredibly frightening to hear that a lot of <unk> , greater than the last one , greater than the last one , or maybe maybe tonight or maybe ...
so the tsunami is going to be seen as a kind of <unk> moment , a moment that the blogosphere might sort of grow up .
it &apos;s probably probably happened to five percent of the number of jellybeans in the jar , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has to link something , so they &apos;re linking other , etc . , etc .
he ended up his <unk> , and i &apos;m waiting for a 300 pound <unk> of paper with a long plans , but he &apos;s saying , &quot; this is all i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now , now , for the end , 30 seconds of the thing without the skin .
and this habitat covered in more of the earth &apos;s land than all of the rest of habitats combined .
many of us , i &apos;m also aware of this , thinking that the depletion of the ocean is only going to be really serious about the last 50 or perhaps 100 years .
these are a cables that are connected vehicles and hands for the work on the bottom .
so there &apos;s a little barcode on this product that &apos;s the computer that &apos;s telling exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they &apos;re doing this , we just don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand-new that will appear in the scientific democratic journal of biology .
but this isn &apos;t all that .
as an architect , i have a little bit of a problem .
mitchell mitchell : don &apos;t build a house , grow it .
i think it &apos;s very interesting and very <unk> , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last days is the sense of walking in different directions : directions that are specifically and unique to the problems .
now , we all think that <unk> was obviously a great romantic poet , many of us forgot that he wrote some wonderful <unk> , and the most famous essay is one of the romantic <unk> .
i &apos;ll read you this .
and at a certain time , they <unk> on rock .
but let me show you the latest robotics .
if you used to be before the digital radio , the <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; on the <unk> , which was this noise .
the basic idea of <unk> <unk> is that you have two sources of information that are the implications of it .
that means i have to make predictions about the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear case , for a matter of me , where a <unk> of me would feel different , as if it was produced by another person .
and in the meanwhile , i got two daughters .
so they knew the rules that they play the other person .
if these dots were cars on a <unk> , they would have no idea what was going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain to a big part of the data -- people actually use their movements precisely to minimize the negative effects of the noise .
this is from the <unk> marine union .
mars has the largest <unk> of the solar system , the <unk> .
this is my <unk> . it was just a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is just 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a <unk> <unk> called <unk> .
we fold it , and we transport it into a <unk> .
this is about <unk> , oregon .
i think on the package , let &apos;s look at this -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these arms for lego , because lego -- the <unk> -- no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of these examples of these examples of stuff that are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , i &apos;ve changed everything that fell on .
perhaps most important , the influence on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is <unk> .
now in brazil , there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , whereas the u.s. has only been 700 , and <unk> two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of <unk> are gone up on top of four percent .
this is not <unk> . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists are explaining to us -- and these are just estimates that we have to cut the throughput of greenhouse gases to be so quick as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to see what we &apos;re fighting against the crisis .
there are always fewer people who are available to you , and then you get this <unk> of the curve , and you get this classic <unk> curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and this happens on every exterior knot .
the red dots are going to be the <unk> , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of people with flu .
would you get immunity to <unk> ?
and there &apos;s , i think , three ways of going to the <unk> data .
the building was in the building , until the collapse of the <unk> economy and death of the <unk> at the beginning of the &apos; 90s .
even though it seems to be a very practical place , if you look at it from the top , it seems to be a whole net of <unk> and channels that are connected every single house .
in this tradition , the future bride all the time that you &apos;re going to get to be going to be about your new husband soon .
what a place like the <unk> david do about doing it is this kind of <unk> , where people have a basis they can use to use .
we can only ask : &quot; what are the hot <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot; and you know , or what we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced the workers by technology .
you can see the links on the screen , which show what &apos;s arm is right .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even , if we get a lot of older , our cars are going to visit , so we can visit people .
they were gone in a moment .
it was always apparent that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me to bring the outcome of the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , just like jewish predators .
i think there are some , actually , many reasons , but there &apos;s only some of us just going to focus on .
he was attracted by the <unk> , he would <unk> it , he was like a <unk> to the light , a little bit of a <unk> .
let me go from door to the international community , and see if there &apos;s some <unk> or no troops for those division .
but for sergio to be too late .
he saw her .
<unk> power is a complicated hero of learning power .
this is jobs and possibilities all over the whole world .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about food , because in fact , this year , last year , and in the <unk> enough food , there &apos;s enough food in the <unk> of every <unk> pounds .
and i &apos;m going to go into these stores , if you &apos;re there , or you go out into the fields to see what you can get , and i &apos;m stuck , you can &apos;t get food .
we see changes in schools through girls .
i want to talk about something i want to call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of sewers and other things are investing instead of doing other things , invest in a school school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing at cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go longer to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many <unk> i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours of being <unk> what i do .
this was never shown .
the <unk> of these magnets is so big that we can see a single neutron in this technology .
you have to be <unk> the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and its resolution enough , then you can actually put all the proteins in your body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us are looking at the reassuring , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the <unk> of a human people .
for example , if i walk this -- -- more than a couple of seconds , they would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the room in teams .
and they &apos;ve all recognized . and this is the melody that &apos;s going to be hearing about the world in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends of mine , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
as we cross miles and miles of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who could be <unk> .
so , as i stand here and i &apos;m talking about the <unk> of about five years .
ten miles off the coast , and at 17,500 feet .
the ocean moves on the ocean and weather , they keep the temperature of temperature and shapes the chemistry around the world .
there &apos;s easy ...
this is the result of the result if you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries for what we &apos;re allowed to take the oceans .
for example , in the past three years , the united states for example have a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world .
we need <unk> , new technologies to study the ocean .
most of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wing of the insects are creating enough to be able to hold themselves in the air .
let &apos;s look at this notion of simplicity .
this is a beautiful image of visual <unk> of a mouse from the lab of jeff <unk> , and you can see the wonderful pictures of brains that he showed in his talk .
they <unk> a <unk> to put any behavior in a different <unk> , and they can think of a different <unk> and pattern and they can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinks tea .
if you look at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to make it out of louder little components , and <unk> , like in a computer .
how many people per <unk> tree are there ? where are they put ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all of these neurons , every single one in their own <unk> , it will activate , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain will soon be solved , mental illness , perceptions : they &apos;re made of neurons and electric signals , and he &apos;s doing it with a supercomputer , the brain with <unk> synapses .
there would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and started this .
what nasa did is actually to get a <unk> that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , think they usually have something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , those who give them very much , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but get it back to the time , it &apos;s more complex .
a online <unk> dollars for 59 .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we don &apos;t know our <unk> system as well .
in medicine , in medicine , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- you can only use your <unk> of the eyes of low energy .
their intensity is going to be a little bit of a very quick , and it can be turned on very quickly .
they &apos;re critical .
but that just by the way .
cars have been able to communicate and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> traffic , and so on .
dna is what is mean .
because they &apos;re actually not so many data .
you have a genome of the genome , and the power of a mature medicine that is better than today -- it &apos;s no side effects .
it &apos;s really easy -- just <unk> genes -- but we could completely blend it .
we don &apos;t run as little organisms alone in the world , but are part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we poison ourselves or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the implication of a lot of us .
now i &apos;m mostly here , because there &apos;s a kind of dig in training on the moment that we have on the side of the people who think that you &apos;re a dog , first of all , by creating rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; <unk> , &quot; just too , and therefore they &apos;re being beaten .
no , we do &quot; puppy , sit , &quot; -- bam , he can attempt to six to 10 .
they are like the golden <unk> .
and i would say it &apos;s not going to be , then you should not be .
not just with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are <unk> are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think that &apos;s still going to work with energy .
because even though i used scientific terms of <unk> , it &apos;s sometimes difficult to make it sound .
and even less rarer , if it &apos;s been covered by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white light .
64 multiplied by 75 .
let &apos;s go through the third question .
the desert crashes , a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus introduced the same tool over 100,000 generations .
you can teach them in the lab , a little bit of <unk> , and there &apos;s also a <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of an object that never happens .
it &apos;s wealth , in the order of your own needs , time to save .
we &apos;ve achieved this as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started with objects like this , this very long , it was a clue that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a mouse mouse ?
but i &apos;m also also about the connections that people are taking , and that &apos;s never a <unk> possibility of the ideas to come to meet and mate , and i &apos;m sure that technology is going to continue to continue to improve and so that &apos;s why the <unk> will continue to improve .
this is as high as a <unk> building , and i &apos;ve been using the statue of the statue as a comparison .
we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then the rapid development is the problem , because how can we discover things that are constantly changing ?
i &apos;ve been talking about -- you know , if you don &apos;t get a diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we &apos;re <unk> a part of their viruses ; they &apos;re new , they &apos;ve previously <unk> rhinoviruses .
after 10 , days with a fever , they came back -- still a <unk> -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it was not been sequenced very often .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . no one has ever seen it before .
a huge battery could have this .
let &apos;s make something that fits the <unk> of the <unk> .
i brought a <unk> with low density , a <unk> with high density , and a salt between .
but david is young and clever , and he wants to make a <unk> , and so he builds -- he then build the first metal metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of all of all of this ?
this video was taken in the <unk> , 6 miles off the coast of <unk> , about 20 meters below the surface .
soon , we realized that our garage wasn &apos;t big enough for this growing project .
i started to be interested in maria <unk> and her methods and how they found that , and how important she found that kids are going to find things themselves , and they &apos;re not being taught to them , in an open way .
evolution often is often seen as this one , which we &apos;ve chosen , but it represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the phase of the space .
our cities are at risk , because many of them are on shore .
there are stars and so forth .
so if we think about <unk> behavior or body language , like the social scientists call , then it turns out . we think about communication .
this is also <unk> , as proud , was studied at jessica <unk> , and she showed that people and young people are blind people , and if they gain at a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you can see these people and see how they &apos;re involved . could you get them to do it , and then they would be involved in more ?
what happens to a <unk> , what happens when you get to step on the <unk> level ? how do you get the following little manipulation , these tiny little increments ?
this is in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , and where can you really apply this ? that &apos;s what of course was important .
these things . people show you what i &apos;m going to show you . you show yourself .
she was totally <unk> , and he said , &quot; i haven &apos;t got anything here . &quot;
they need their body , privacy and two minutes . it can impact more and more and more .
<unk> swimming in order to get to your <unk> , to get to your <unk> , an ant , <unk> your brain and drive a blade of grass up as a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i realize that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they are extinct extinct .
but among all these ideas that are very much of the most important thing to spread around the world are many toxic ideas .
and like viruses , we don &apos;t want to try to crush them .
and in my game , you &apos;re <unk> .
we made some ideas on the legs , we went international on tours .
i know you &apos;ll be in , i &apos;ll say , &quot; t , there &apos;s no in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
no one hears each other . no one &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to get out of that , that &apos;s not to be able to do , but that we need to be better , if it &apos;s about trying to answer the question , to consider the question , if you think about the consequences and reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re the driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day , building a <unk> on and told me that they don &apos;t marry any children , before these things are done .
finally , from despair , went and <unk> , and <unk> a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , when you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re the best talking to keep the best speech you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message also was the unit that was linked by everything , and the unit of everything , and his basic value was respect , to strangers .
who is fighting , while he &apos;s going ?
they start to go to go to israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more <unk> . and recently , she has now a income to support their family .
just go to somebody , with another culture , from another country , with a different <unk> , which is kind of different and <unk> it to talk to it , listen to him .
i &apos;ll start where the story began , 1985 .
today , before you <unk> , who had a chance of a shower for who ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a working shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re trying to do , are the following <unk> , things that were actually built up with some of the stuff .
we did this . he was brought down .
we later found that in this region , the cause of disease and death is .
one thing that &apos;s related to what we did , in the middle of the <unk> , nelson mandela said , &quot; how slavery and defeating apartheid is not <unk> . it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t get much ashamed if you call me a <unk> . really not .
it really sounds like this , which is to say up here , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s really amazing .
and i am going to go to you in the belief that children don &apos;t have to leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest <unk> <unk> in america in america with our <unk> of the bronx .
this is a picture from the mayor of the bronx who <unk> the kids in his house , not in prison , so they felt <unk> .
we gave back a little bit .
if you &apos;re a big <unk> kids , you &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and it creates this responsibility , <unk> that is incredible .
now you might wonder about these children .
hold kids from these shops .
stephen coleman : a schoolteacher , the south bronx began to <unk>
secondly , i bet you &apos;ll be a <unk> , and the difference here is a rising <unk> of the heat that is the sharp line .
to 10 : <unk> failure , the pig &apos;s been a heart attack .
people with migraine headaches who have an <unk> neuron , a band with <unk> neurons -- here in red -- and that &apos;s going to be a minute of the five millimeters to a <unk> .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- an <unk> acronym -- for treatment of other <unk> .
lawyers and over time , on <unk> , the hope of <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the poor patients with their own <unk> .
and a half years ago , four of five of the <unk> at ushahidi , which means &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is also <unk> .
how do you know what &apos;s important to that ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i just got it to the first time to get it to come here .
these people below the barrier , i &apos;m going to <unk> because they &apos;re really going to be excluded from the process to share their knowledge with the world .
they have taken to develop packages as a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> , who teach teachers the teaching stories to the world teachers .
yeah , books , maybe 100 or 1,000 gas companies are sold in year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that it &apos;s all like , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so this is not very hard .
the days of the <unk> are over when people say , &quot; well , we would like to have three or <unk> of it in our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a few thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s such a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop that you can &apos;t do .
and that &apos;s the <unk> .
you click on things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up with it .
thank you .
i think most people think that a pregnant mother , always their child .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s all good . you &apos;re going to live .
first , the <unk> of the world .
two years ago , one of the mentor mentor came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system on ?
the <unk> is , how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray matter at age four to 22 years , take it in childhood , which is this chart . it &apos;s <unk> in the early adolescence .
the idea that your father is singing in the public , was enough to <unk> .
this is the <unk> we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that online stayed there , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but in the night , as we were asked , i asked the <unk> , as the <unk> decided , would give you the sam kiss .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family works for four generations in the field of entertainment .
honestly , i have no idea what it was <unk> , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you see in the <unk> is the horrible force of the <unk> .
he just wrap it up to get up my leg , raise me up , get me to a car and can get me a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about it . &quot;
we &apos;ve calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct direct world with the world .
it &apos;s so simple , technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> , like technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i &apos;d love to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you , corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , you know , in every community , you have to increase the number of sharks .
i ran three main <unk> to antarctica .
but i &apos;m telling where they are and what country they are . &quot;
we &apos;ve also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re facing the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and open seas <unk> , but the <unk> , everyone likes to look at , was in trouble .
this is the pacific , with enormous <unk> and enormous <unk> .
now there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , automatic <unk> for free , and many of our devices , even the print .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no way to get there , not a single answer to it , but if you &apos;re a big <unk> like me , then you say , &quot; well , what are the data ? &quot;
instead , he has documented very carefully , which is happening over and over again , if technology comes to the first time in a community and a community .
so there &apos;s this , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> painting .
i mean , that was at least as i was happy .
well , there was a question that i had a question that was a while in mind , well , can i do more of the things that i &apos;d like to do in design , and less of those i don &apos;t like to do that ?
and here it &apos;s on the front .
they are a terrible situation without road .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> in hospitals .
as an <unk> , for example , i was looked at the <unk> , because i &apos;ve had the <unk> <unk> , and i know how i need to use <unk> , and i can do quickly with the <unk> .
i saw this score of older people in this &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , are active as a <unk> , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
as christian <unk> changed and made made of <unk> <unk> , were made young women , young jewish men in the u.s. and canada , and superman , they also returned to the bible .
the last muslim <unk> of europe , of the last muslim world of europe .
the biggest guy , <unk> , don &apos;t want these stone <unk> . so he tries to prevent them on the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is yemen .
&quot; and , when does the article out ? &quot;
<unk> : there must be something we can do .
&#91; &quot; &#93; the 99 &quot; &#93; .
it &apos;s dangerous if a group of themselves identified as extremely .
<unk> <unk> : from islam <unk>
let &apos;s look at it .
let me point out for you .
let me show you this here .
and when i started designing this , i &apos;ve discovered something weird about myself .
so you have the eye and then get the concepts .
but of course china also has a tremendous population .
but what this is is showing is that this kind of visualization of information is a form of the <unk> .
it &apos;s actually pleasure to be concerned about it , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is to be named after the eden of the project .
why does it not smell like this , or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a theory to work less .
now , after a few months , i &apos;ve discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly what it has done .
this is the basis of the device that these two people built from ford .
they made it -- and it has exactly like coumarin smell .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things is going to be very careful about it .
and she actually had no idea of the context that she had landed .
norman !
i told no <unk> , neither my mom , nor my father , not my sister , my sister , my sister , my sister , my <unk> , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , no one .
i &apos;m going to show from that . i just am saying to say that i had two things when i left the patient who wanted to make the fire i was going to do , and that was my family and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you say , one of us there are running over and little bits .
he had a <unk> and so to get <unk> from others , female and probably much smaller family members to achieve his age of 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation , or will it lead that we will be the <unk> of the way that exist on the planet earth ?
but will we do that , or will we let nature go through the run ?
one day , a few weeks or a few weeks , i was a <unk> <unk> in a shop for <unk> , and i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my point : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you know , how obsessed i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i &apos;ve gone so far , i went to buy a chinese newspaper from the city of san francisco to buy the bird of the bird in the city ...
when we <unk> the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was perfect <unk> : the sun , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever get back , you just get a <unk> . &quot;
i remember my father went out in a wheelchair , and i went from the top up to the top , and i felt the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to you , because we think that would be good for you . &quot;
she was denied me the <unk> , and i called the school school , i went and said that i wanted to be a <unk> <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m going to work in love .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> <unk> by a richard serra .
how to hell i do a phone in three weeks , if i have developed these things over millions of years ?
each of these elements could hang on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
his days was the highest taxpayer in british .
i &apos;m looking at the <unk> and how you are moving and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s been <unk> from aluminum , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you ask it to contemporary architecture , it feels like me totally , of course .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from kevlar .
and the same after i had done my dr. dr. was the lucky part of a <unk> , which used for the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these <unk> .
he uses red light like a <unk> to <unk> around animals that are blind to the red light and can see them without being seen .
so they use it to find food and mate .
i urge you to call me a different science that uses this whole technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made up to rediscover the value of the <unk> .
and on june , 1995 , i stopped a loud bang on the wheel that changed my life and the duck .
and here &apos;s the duck .
after the price of changed my life .
another example of the impact of <unk> on the lives of birds .
so , if i &apos;m like this , this is the sound of purple .
depending on how i <unk> it , i can hear and write the food with the eating of music .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is about hitler .
now , you can see more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more , that the former <unk> are now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything that could be used to be used . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens if teachers want to make a fuck ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so that freedom has been a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and greatest change : we need to be authority for the interpretation and application of law and sent back to the <unk> .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it &apos;s going to be fully complete complete considerably .
<unk> boundaries for the interest that can compute <unk> and for the fees that can take them .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult to drag up <unk> with a ruler .
he had a very bad job for paying for it .
he had only one <unk> .
but the problem of getting on the rules and incentives , is that they are doing professional activity , and they &apos;re <unk> the professional activity in two ways .
so bright <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine if any intelligent <unk> can get this for for specific time .
why did this spread ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to try to replicate something more specifically that we -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was <unk> , the turtle .
we have a fully <unk> operation with a complete computer .
what i want to show you is what they needed to transport up to the 34 of 34 , they &apos;re so highly <unk> .
what if they had had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring trucks that you just saw , somewhere in here .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself , are overwhelmed by the mind of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me to me , the one who is a <unk> of the <unk> , the fact that it was tough .
there are a lot of black sheep out there who did things and the problems have gone .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them into ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous working environment .
imagine , we could , because if we could , we could get more .
the governments that are making most progress are the governments that have found ways to have shared value in business , rather than the government has to see the actor that will say that .
maybe i can cut this up here , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come with me to the 19th century , just in june , june , <unk> .
we could certainly be all so productive if facebook or twitter don &apos;t give us so much time .
they were looking for <unk> to the british government to get money from the <unk> machines , because they thought that these machines have enormous practical effects for society .
these benefits , they didn &apos;t make any money for less wealthy men , but they also <unk> to look at the <unk> , rather than just answer the <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i was learning about life .
once you start looking at the very small things -- this person has written a whole article and said , &quot; hey , that &apos;s bacteria . &quot;
and all of the ones who aren &apos;t old enough , they have no idea how this infection happened -- which is through these <unk> .
there &apos;s about 10,000 programs in the world .
this would be the rate that you can find any of the 26 letters of the <unk> in one of randomly chosen apes can find written .
wherever you live , you will have this distribution in contrast that distribution .
hot , too hot .
the officer says , &quot; are you sure ? hey , buddy , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost this ? &quot;
this is the data from a single survey to <unk> in a single district in zambia , a few years ago , i &apos;ve got a <unk> .
as you see , bruce willis was much more hair in the middle .
you could talk about 10,000 or 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time or it was fit in my plan , and i &apos;m not just on holiday .
instead of teaching people to teach people how to put the paper forms on the cell phones , we should design a software that lets them do it , without practice and without my <unk> .
that &apos;s less than i was doing at the time , when i went to two weeks , when i went to college .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , life or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need to have a <unk> .
i promised myself that i &apos;m going to take the next time , if i would fly around the world , not to take a fuel , independent from fossil fuels to be secure , not to be threatened by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot at the airplane that can talk to the universities who can speak to students who can talk to students with flight , and it really can make it really easy to an human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all people who believe in this brain theory are to be part of this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to do is to create clarity , what is that problem , and what it isn &apos;t .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second with the nonsense .
in fact , we are the first generation of the disease and the extreme poverty in the eyes , look over the ocean , say it and my point it . we don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s going to be on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the <unk> states that have been in and <unk> and look the world .
people find it slowly .
and with this one campaign as our umbrella , my organization , data , and other groups of energy and the enthusiasm that are out of the <unk> from hollywood to the <unk> of america .
step forward : step forward , a nurse , a schoolteacher , a <unk> and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet has changed all their lives , a country can change , and a continent that &apos;s just made to be so analog , let alone , to digital -- just just <unk> me .
lips are not lips , it &apos;s volcanoes .
so your job is to recognize what these shapes is bouba , and what is kiki .
now if you &apos;re not just <unk> , then this sentence is literally false .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare what we already know , with what &apos;s known to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m happy to be here .
you don &apos;t even adjust yourself to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how are you about it with it , but it also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was big .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt eating like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you &apos;re probably going to land on the intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms of <unk> and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i never would see my home .
i sat there and i was talking about the <unk> for transplants and asked him what i was going to do if i needed a transplant , could be ready for me .
i was hanging on a dozen machines that thought me .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> is in the u.s. to get 200 percent in the u.s.
and also , interestingly , the same thing that &apos;s the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; <unk> &quot; , today the antidote to sell -- a and the same company .
we also launched as a weapon of mass .
what would our young children say to us if you even say a child once every day , i had a little bit of <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little bit of a <unk> .
the problem is that you see in my village , oakland , most of our villages , that connection is not .
here &apos;s the accumulation of the <unk> <unk> alongside the airport airport from los angeles .
i offered five cents for every time .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s global .
here you see , in red , the distribution of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks like an elephant , and the greatest part of them is hidden .
it looks like your <unk> and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that extends into the sky , because they tend to something called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , live longer .
it &apos;s totally <unk> , that &apos;s what to see .
but since the other time , all the doors is opening up to the <unk> , and the walls break .
this was 25 years ago .
let &apos;s first look at the <unk> .
how do these people do these infected computers ?
and you can afford to watch it , as we work -- how do we work -- how do we work -- and try to find a way to avoid the <unk> that we meet .
and you &apos;ll find out there , you can see a <unk> , <unk> / d / <unk> , and if you open this file file on your computer , this program is downloaded and <unk> .
and if you look at the scene of the scene , you can see that the <unk> is the winner of the mercedes .
we need to find any way that it &apos;s going to be very close , even when the computer is going to be .
but i have nothing to do with that .
that &apos;s what they have with <unk> .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does your future look like ?
these forces completely shut , no one &apos;s <unk> .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and they would participate in the kinds of computation , and they would participate , because this would change things , but it would change things in two ways of computation .
that means that we recognize a copy of ourselves , if you &apos;ve done one part of the <unk> , you &apos;ve used a <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their <unk> and saw that their video was suddenly spread as a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go into the distance .
this is what it was taught to do , since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like , who taught me how to browse .
what is it driving you today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re going to do and do it ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . did not the -- time . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t .
in this moment , consciously or <unk> , and the moment you &apos;re going to <unk> , you can make a sense of meaning and whatever it means , it makes emotion .
have you ever done , and then they went , &quot; that &apos;s me ! &quot;
too deaths , <unk> , and so god in his infinite wisdom , there &apos;s another human desire : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through <unk> , through movements in nature .
and there are seven different points . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through bin . the last element is emotion .
jewish man in <unk> field would have died in new york , someone who died in new york , if he was in the day of the day , and this man who was a terrorist wanted to say it clearly .
but instead , i &apos;m interested in developing the tools that a great number of people tell their stories , people around the world .
the color of particles is kind of feeling -- happy , positive emotion , luminous colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to walk the list , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the ten issues of the rays and circle around the time capsule .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : revelation of modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this and see this iconic picture of betty ford , like she &apos;s supposed to the <unk> of her husband .
you can see yourself as well as the climate change as you want to read .
so people are feeling clouds than something that is in the way .
in life , it has started tens of thousands of members of the earth today .
you just need one step to go outside , and to note that , so you know , so so so so so so so so so so , you &apos;re missing the other one .
so look up , they admire the <unk> beauty , and think always to carry the head in clouds .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> would have made this like this : &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> , and it was a big machine .
these footage came from a virtual autopsy .
you can see here , the knife in heart is invaded .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen , which has built into its inner very , very fast <unk> .
now this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very <unk> people .
i went out with the kids as much as possible to bring the academic stuff in relation to the real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> , <unk> of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details why we &apos;re familiar with the universe so , but it makes sense of mathematics and trying to explain the physics that we know .
i always add something in my career .
in 2001 , i went to a visit during a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is the first degree of the first ever ever thought in 2004 .
he &apos;s just recently about the <unk> , and was filmed with somebody who &apos;s all familiar with somebody .
each one is <unk> <unk> , but in different scientific disciplines .
i got my first computer in accra , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri , and he says , this is the most beautiful brain he ever did .
and then the next few slides i &apos;ll just tell you about this .
transistors are smaller , to enable that , and that &apos;s what our technology is doing a lot better .
our <unk> is behind this lens here .
i had a sense of gut , that we &apos;re going to go wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
so we can see more detail in our galaxy than anywhere else .
and that &apos;s a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it moves on a page more stronger than the other and the cloud will be ripped apart .
and i hope that i &apos;m at least convinced you that we really have a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and saw some kids between stairs , cars and playing baseball .
for example , people were pieces in the russian century that ended up so .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , about the big &quot; what &quot; is &quot; and &quot; <unk> god .
through new and improved instruments , we broke the age of <unk> .
but a question is , what happens if the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music , and emotions throughout time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new millennium .
and 1945 , they took it on 100,000 every year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest in this process was given great <unk> , because there &apos;s been possible to do something really cool .
well , i think this is the most salient development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; fine-grained innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important .
we get a great talk about them .
so let me introduce this to this point sam <unk> .
but even if you squint , you get more <unk> than words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge online and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how <unk> global innovation is innovation .
one : i have to be a speaker to make a service and talk about what i &apos;m going to give to give to say what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they will have fun to design their own ultimate or <unk> tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them sugar , so kind of a <unk> that we call the right .
this kind of testing do this , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and the thought he could reverse the ocean . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three major changes , and in the fields , transparency , choices and <unk> , where people have really power to really do .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon <unk> , claims , all over the world , there are more pictures of your head than everybody else .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , people were teaching teachers and mris as a helpful <unk> device , because they took on specific areas where they make a meaningful sense .
so i wish all of a big seller .
dna to read and write , it becomes easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now , you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do ? &quot;
if you &apos;ve got this <unk> around the world , this can be a <unk> <unk> , which allows you to do biotechnology .
the kingdom says , his laws will allow him to be foreign <unk> or <unk> , who will make an economic risk or a <unk> risk or a risk for health or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are <unk> into the face of science and based on prejudice and ignorance and an iranian of traditions and an <unk> <unk> .
why are you going to be pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 <unk> people who inject drugs .
so the social workers that are used condoms for endangered water agencies , and they &apos;re <unk> , they are locked in <unk> .
these were born children , people were born there .
office office in personal work are obsolete now .
they removed the high line , the road <unk> , the flow underneath the road , and you get from a <unk> to the other , without crossing the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments in our own . &quot;
also , jobs should be shared .
your liver is <unk> oil .
and they killed by 12,000 sharks to the time , by actually just a <unk> bay from the <unk> mountains in <unk> bay .
we know very little about it .
so this tag is going to find a place where the time and the sunset , the water and the <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at the <unk> , which has been passed on the gene , to do what the parents passed from the parent , we see basking sharks , compared to the first trial , a factor of 10 times more than other <unk> .
so , <unk> , this research and found out that the size is about 9,000 .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build it . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists whether they were from a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the <unk> .
your body become broken apart , and they &apos;re destined to be used for any <unk> , to make money -- people tell many such stories .
no business with anybody &apos;s done .
my journalism may not fit other continents or other countries , in my part of africa , but it &apos;s working on corruption , ask the people immediately , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks removed from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as a <unk> <unk> .
and had this ever been aware of the victim of their <unk> ?
today , you can have 29 states , more than half of the country , because of its sexuality , <unk> will be attributed .
and at some point , i realized that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was wrong , because there was a million different <unk> of gay .
i hope that it &apos;s harder to do , and it &apos;s going to be harder to move your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to be good and evil , because good , yin and evil , yin and yang are <unk> .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that were made the soldier .
in three ways : the conventional way is that it &apos;s essential .
this is stanley , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust happen here , here &apos;s now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord who is responsible if you happen to do something ? &quot;
stanley mcchrystal , and i was actually released the high school , and he was james <unk> in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> the other . <unk> of self .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil through the heart of one person is going .
and i have put the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on .
it &apos;s a puzzle that was really hard to do .
we have one self .
but on my left retina , there &apos;s a <unk> , which is the <unk> .
there &apos;s only one <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not going to say anything , except that it &apos;s supposed to be scary .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for being -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m going to tell you this -- i &apos;m telling you this and i &apos;m going to tell you about it and <unk> , because i think the feminism has been partly the duty , to admit , aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want to heroine .
you &apos;ve got to tell me , i didn &apos;t put me on fire .
she talked about <unk> , she founded <unk> , she <unk> her friends -- all of these everyday acts of caring and creativity .
i mean by that , it &apos;s this <unk> that is homo sapiens from earlier <unk> .
in fact , this is a sensor that the electrical activity reads in my brain , while i &apos;m going to read this talk .
we <unk> lots of prototypes and products that you can control with thoughts , like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
the headset that is the headset , is wireless with an ipad or a smartphone .
how these children can use their new awareness to their recovery , will be a lot of the detrimental and <unk> social <unk> , which people are being diagnosed as a different way to see .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value that we &apos;re in people , and it &apos;s changing , <unk> and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my opportunity .
meanwhile , the <unk> , and quite unexpected , they would give up .
this <unk> thought not to look at my eyes .
i was walking around a track i &apos;m good .
and it &apos;s quite slowly happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe me , not all of me , not all of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
i &apos;m so . my whole thing .
what we have is the same thing that &apos;s happening , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , they feel great , and they &apos;re just horrible in the posture of a small change in attitude , feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate , the place to be the level of control that we have over our tax .
for <unk> percent of this money , you would have to be <unk> into the trains , which would not have gone down the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the use of the treatment would have been improving .
i &apos;m not asking a story about the other one .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a <unk> discipline to human psychology .
if the average response to 60 percent of the time .
it &apos;s not going to tell you that you don &apos;t even hurt yourself .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that would not mean that i have a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin of the observable universe .
thank you .
we had hyperscore with hyperscore , actually , we have really strong effects in children around the world , and now people every age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , so , powerful , for forever life .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old , i have <unk> .
this is actually the musical score of <unk> play that he has completely composed in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , let &apos;s make a <unk> .
there &apos;s a present time that &apos;s the present self .
i have to write five sides on the day writing articles , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that today will work . &quot;
and i &apos;ll show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last <unk> time , something i &apos;m going to show you with hal <unk> , which was introduced to me , and i was introduced to a previous project , bill <unk> .
and it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not really affected , because when one of the faces smiles , the other face is <unk> <unk> .
this is one of the reasons that what we &apos;re interested in western science , mathematics and <unk> , in fact , in the first few centuries of our <unk> , of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown because there &apos;s no &quot; sh . &quot;
so , this is not that if you &apos;re talking about psychiatric illnesses , you &apos;re probably going to be the stories of <unk> suffering , shame and discrimination in almost every wind of life .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world were gathered in <unk> and gave them the legendary declaration .
what &apos;s it going to do ?
if you look at the level of the species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish already .
if you look at this returns , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually <unk> .
this was in the early stages of <unk> when india was going to be going to be <unk> , as a means for birth -- after china with its <unk> growth , of eight , nine , 10 percent and said , why can &apos;t we do that ?
that &apos;s not what you &apos;re going to get happy to do , but you have the trust and the courage to say , &quot; we have calculated that .
green carbon , so the emissions that are growing through deforestation and agriculture , and rain water forming 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things are doing , dick , not , by the way , not -- in sydney , by the way .
i also liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said he was basically the same relationship with his dad .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they don &apos;t , and because they don &apos;t move in the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color , which is just fantastic <unk> .
many of these ideas are produced <unk> into airstream .
if you think about it , your children to send the tinkering school , they will return to <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let them play with their own conditions and trust them , they &apos;re going to learn things that they cannot learn from the <unk> .
if you want to throw away next time , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all that . this is number <unk> . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife wander , and here my wife , four months after , in aspen , and good health .
how about a complete <unk> horizon , not just sharing the sharing ?
this is one of the seven ones that are not in the <unk> that they don &apos;t have to be shot .
and so it came to buy the entire <unk> western <unk> western <unk> , for example , for example , then hundreds of thousands and finally millions of individual , small versions of print that one in the middle of the hell should be put in the middle of the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
when the edison invented the light bulb , it looked like this .
you have to be pretty smart , and even though i don &apos;t have a <unk> , that doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m dumb , because you can &apos;t be dumb today , and you can &apos;t be able to get it to the world .
they literally got us the door .
if you listen to the <unk> of your <unk> , both of your ears are two .
we have the problem that the antenna <unk> .
thank you .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m interested in systems and <unk> .
i recently made some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her own special map , and writing her names on it , <unk> them and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see you &apos;re going to go .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and extended life of life on earth that &apos;s right with this .
he &apos;s trying to hold his position in this mode .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
so , let &apos;s think about the future of technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at the <unk> , you see the amino acids with the <unk> that you have different charges .
and through a series of <unk> , you can get one of a billion fish , what you want to do , like , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see <unk> .
if you ask people the question : where do you have something important to do this ?
i &apos;ve been doing my <unk> computer , i used my expensive computers .
and what happens -- sometimes you wake up in the morning , and you wake up at eight o &apos;clock in the morning or to seven or when you get up , and you say , man , i didn &apos;t really have a good job .
in the office , most of the <unk> and distractions that actually do work from work , <unk> .
we all know that that &apos;s true . you would never have a <unk> meeting , that by employees will be taught .
meetings and managers are now the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe two weeks , or every week , the week , the day , <unk> , no one week .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this seven years , and i have no idea what the future is going to look like .
but if you ask people to the three most important things that you wear , whether you have the culture , which is the sex and the context -- most people -- the key , money , and if you own one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big but , but we &apos;ve got to forget the tendency .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent <unk> , and then -- the owner of the <unk> takes 10 or 20 percent of the <unk> , and there &apos;s the rest of the amount of bar to my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he sort of got an tribute to the values of <unk> .
at the same time , the spread of these mobile devices are seeing a expectation of the availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell later about it .
what were we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research that show us how to affect the <unk> of <unk> , how to make people feel more productive . he tells for example that if we &apos;re living healthier , better eating , exercise and love , our brain cells are actually replicate .
and i tell you who has said .
within this context , we can feel about regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i got my tattoo , i stayed up almost all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s still a fifth .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer to all &quot; <unk> can let us go back to <unk> for days .
and as i used to say , i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought i would try to try to go to my ted wish to try to explain what i try and do what i try and do what they &apos;re trying to do .
not in india , now , at least one half a million active .
and i came to thought that somebody in this whole unified world has to be thinking about the organization of the <unk> .
and so we did it to do that .
listen to : less than four tenth of one percent of those who were treated , they were pushed the vessels of their drugs or <unk> in the ways of their treatment .
it &apos;s a trial , and i think it &apos;s successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
if the <unk> is available , it will make up 5,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
<unk> women from bali to <unk> the food and they were using secrets , they know just their grandmothers .
we need someone who &apos;s coming and studied this .
green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords , they were healthy and not <unk> . &quot;
then apple alex turns out , the best i had heard of .
there was a reason for that , that was me .
the <unk> is not natural .
but that &apos;s not about .
initially , the internet was a <unk> tool , now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave for my real , daily life .
&quot; it &apos;s human , to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing test .
before i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you alive ? &quot;
we treated two <unk> sites as a single page , because so it &apos;s true to readers .
so what is the lesson behind this ?
and one day , my grandmother , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not going to run .
it &apos;s <unk> and terrible things happened with me .
everybody lost hope in my recovery .
so they went to their <unk> , and all the <unk> were their <unk> furniture -- they gave me a <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
they don &apos;t know how far away from these street , and they don &apos;t know if they go straight and they &apos;re going to throw cars and forth cars , and they had a horrible accident that has brought them to that .
i thought that for some reason they stayed the time and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we argue , we would have discovered all the symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn around , because i &apos;ve built a little hurdle , right ?
if i put a magic train , and then it &apos;s a third one .
galois has a series of policies that are like these tables , these symmetries , interact .
and then , one symmetry we call <unk> .
instead of all , i want to call all the mess , i want to know how many digits do it . ok ?
i need to have your name . symmetrical objects are -- please , please spell it for me .
first : bad nutrition , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison had a very <unk> situation in a software company .
penicillin was discovered in the past , but even in 1940 , in 1940 , no commercial and <unk> useful amounts of it .
it was the origin of the <unk> , which last year his year had been 50 birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos happens . we do the best one .
it works with every computer and the browser , minus , minus , minus and the text becomes smaller .
they don &apos;t need to be <unk> .
and so a kind of information that i &apos;m going to make inspired , my real desk .
a means of a way , something like a <unk> , so you get more traditional desktop , and things are designed by grid .
now i get to my music the heart of man and there &apos;s no limit anymore .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with the bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to make the role of contemporary math -- not just <unk> , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on wall street , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here , this is a book about flying that maybe you &apos;ve got on amazon .
they &apos;re not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money , which is actually so interesting .
go . shake . all right !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> , <unk> , so with <unk> , many life , but there &apos;s a diet flow of them .
the answer is to allow cars to come from the side of the road .
warren <unk> had this really , honestly , to say what works and what doesn &apos;t work and make this to a annual thing .
in fact , we see the <unk> , that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the living in africa , in africa , has been given several things to avoid the <unk> .
this means that the economy is going to be <unk> , because it &apos;s just that much avoid that much .
but that &apos;s not a <unk> of us .
not only was it , it &apos;s weak ; it &apos;s getting weaker .
a schoolteacher becomes a teacher &apos;s performance -- measured in <unk> -- in a year by 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship in no relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and those free courses could not only be available on the internet , but you can also do some other dvds , so that anyone with access to a <unk> have the best teachers .
normal vessels , like this cup , takes eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought when he was young elected , he was a painter and he was living in florence his high school in florence .
and when i look at these pictures , i &apos;m going to put the smoke on my clothes when i went home to my family .
my parents were very fond of great . they said , &quot; well , we know that you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us so powerful ?
this is a general in boston .
the pathologist takes the sample , <unk> it , <unk> it , and then the operating room .
so in this protocell , a solution , a solution , with these <unk> molecules , combined with a dye , shown here , green , <unk> , in the <unk> of a cancer , normal can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with <unk> lymph node , as part of our current <unk> , the surgeon begins to the individual node , the lymph node where cancer starts .
when nerves are damaged , they can cause paralysis , and hurt .
so , when we <unk> these two samples ...
we know that this is doable and we &apos;re determined to realize that .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of information that we &apos;re learning from .
it &apos;s going to affect the same circuitry in the same way as the ones that are supposed to fix .
and one morning in the summer of 2004 , we tried it , and it &apos;s been going to work .
we &apos;ve shown that there &apos;s been a quick <unk> of these cells to make learning .
and it goes . right now .
i want to end with a story that we might have in clinical application , perhaps , in some clinical application .
now , you can see that the animal actually can <unk> the walls and can use the little platform and can use his eyes again .
buildings are colonized for the air , the <unk> microbes that are using the windows and the <unk> .
and if you stop out , there &apos;s the air that are associated with <unk> and the dirt .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical very strong person , and you see , i had no worry , to wear this thing 20 blocks .
the same is true for the question , who was alive after 9 / 11 , the streets of the neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things that i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract and you search for google , and then you look at these results in these regions .
this is chasing <unk> . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side , you &apos;re linking to one .
what was the case for us all about 40 years ago -- that tell us about stories of generations -- is rarely .
and in 1939 , the film is older than most of the grandparents of our members .
was a story good about it ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as reading ?
in california , they &apos;re sending out of a <unk> : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are going from the state of california to be seen by cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so we could be able to develop a <unk> , and i think , and for my career as an architect , it &apos;s a <unk> , that the words &quot; humility &quot; since the eternal <unk> is not mentioned in the same section .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve been in his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone age ended up because we &apos;ve gone stones . &quot;
and this can be all right , but we &apos;ve built <unk> on houston , and all windows are closed , and all the windows are closed , and all of the products that obviously didn &apos;t grow into measurably designed , which is actually a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you are using it .
since then we &apos;ve been doing the 4,000 most , the <unk> <unk> in a database that we &apos;re going to provide in six weeks of public .
now we have a <unk> <unk> heavy <unk> of the internet population .
we started using commercial and mixed with buildings that are all people and have become centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you , we knew all of that , because we didn &apos;t know .
for example , if you were to say that the <unk> at microsoft began to say microsoft / 11 , the yahoo on the 12th march of 2008 , and then the other : google , facebook , facebook and so on .
i chose sweden , because sweden were similar laws of what the united states has .
and whoever told you , he has nothing to hide on it , it &apos;s not thought enough .
and their email were read and i talked to her in the closet and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right to privacy , there can &apos;t be real freedom of freedom , and therefore , it cannot be effective democracy . &quot;
many people , if you take a <unk> human brain , say , &quot; normally it looks different if you get a brain . &quot;
all of these empty areas , the areas that are going through where they go through .
and the creatures of a particular cell , his to be able to make biochemistry , is that it determines the 25,000 genes turned on and then where they are turned on .
now experts are experts in play and make some basic anatomical .
we take this off material , put it on a so-called <unk> .
what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genome and they &apos;re trying to find <unk> , which are linked to the genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
we know how to eradicate poverty , we need to just do more ?
so here &apos;s some more questions .
how can you know ?
so what is the problem ?
good , it was equal to all the same .
and it was done many experiments that came to the same outcome , so i &apos;ll just tell you about one .
so what is the best part ?
we need this kind of information , we need more of it , and we need to drive politics .
and maybe we start small , with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re going to act .
poverty is more <unk> than scientific health , and a lack of data about the effects of <unk> , and a lack of data on how you think about this . but <unk> , esther duflo thinks it &apos;s possible to help <unk> and what damage -- with help with help .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , we see a very different way .
and the legend was told that alexander through this desert was going to go .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with over 1,000 languages , and it would be a little bit . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk about this from perspective of the <unk> .
in tanzania , last week of the standard for <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was in 2005 for the world &apos;s best performance ? &quot; would you think about egypt ?
because there &apos;s fascinating ways .
&quot; god , &quot; is the journey that we &apos;re all going to want to be inspired and to feel about the universe that is <unk> .
you put a switch on -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought .
i &apos;m going to let you run this , so you can kind of describe it , and i &apos;m going to describe my response to the very first time i saw this .
right .
ok , move , raise your right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no , no . i see only on the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , it &apos;s gone .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let your eyes close , in five , four , three , three , one .
only when you want the pressure released , you make a <unk> , so , but only if you want the pressure released .
do you want to try it ?
you feel a certain sensation , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw this <unk> into the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is here , so in <unk> .
kb : ok . think it &apos;s here , yes , or no ?
first , designer barry , how our brain can <unk> our bodies -- with a trick that has also done by <unk> , and then he put the audience into some incredible <unk> of brain brain .
i &apos;m <unk> .
this is not for &quot; one of four . &quot; that &apos;s for all four .
i observed that both religious , as well as people are obsessed with moral .
the <unk> is almost zero if there &apos;s no stimulation for the <unk> .
and you get this message from the computer , &quot; person 1 has sent them to this crowd .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin increases in <unk> <unk> to increase 80 percent .
i &apos;ve found the molecule to it .
and he asked me , &quot; what shall we do ? &quot;
in experiments , we have testosterone testosterone .
and this tells us that we invented this ritual to connect with this new couple of other .
and it &apos;s easy to engage in the <unk> .
to bring the machine to run , you need lots and lots of people .
or should you not ?
they said , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a machine , which is just working on english , so we taught ourselves english so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
<unk> , but i had to follow the victorian domain .
how will that tomorrow be ?
we need to do this <unk> from threat to the <unk> .
i think it &apos;s the focus .
i &apos;ve got an incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will you end ? &quot; -- a nine-year-old .
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i &apos;ve lost it completely .
<unk> went to the local <unk> in uttar pradesh and found that he was pushed into the official <unk> .
so this is <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged layer that &apos;s able to pay for numbers and multiple households , and they &apos;re common .
after these four children , you see the <unk> younger sister who were also told children who were killed .
and finally , there was a single one that was <unk> for me and later his <unk> withdrew , so i had to <unk> him so that it &apos;s <unk> .
with 16 , the children have to leave the orphanage , even though they &apos;re often not going to go nowhere .
one of the interesting things is , of course , the <unk> hand on the instrument and the technology , and of course , what he told about the listening to our young people .
now my career could continue a little bit longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
it comes from the <unk> .
or we do this and believe that is blindness .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual touch . but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a music ?
in this <unk> <unk> , the dove <unk> evelyn , why can hear music <unk> to make a lot more likely to be sound waves on the earth .
and it was so big , until the point where it was a <unk> last year at <unk> &apos;s english and rick <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; millions of people on tv .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky that it &apos;s not going to be a live to you .
peace and love was mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what you should .
that &apos;s 10 times longer than mammals needed to reach their maximum body size and conquer all those habitats .
we &apos;re sort of like the dinosaurs , and are unusual in our <unk> attitude for life .
basically , it &apos;s a country that had no <unk> work in the beginning of our work .
this is a adult <unk> in his pine room .
paul has never seen a fossil so , you know , <unk> .
these are all <unk> . there are a number of possibilities .
i was an artist and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;re involved with this question for centuries -- how do you solve these children in science .
bad news for derartu tulu though -- some other <unk> had the same idea underneath the olympic <unk> and paula radcliffe , which is a tremendously , distance from the same <unk> of all time .
show me an animal with <unk> and elegantly , it &apos;s got to do something with water .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we &apos;re the largest <unk> in the jungle .
well , emily <unk> -- one of the 500 monks and <unk> -- it ends up the eighth spot , under the best 10 , although she has done all the <unk> <unk> to beat her baby during the <unk> baby -- and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s all that we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
stop in the middle of these <unk> , where you failed , if you need four hours .
the lesson of the discovery was always about , with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that , of course , for us , and that people really would help to accept robots as part of our everyday life .
so , monster monster is very , evil .
the <unk> was a <unk> from our group , where they used three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can get to the active participants in your grandchildren today , in a way it &apos;s not possible .
and the third way was a simple journal with a piece and pencil , because that &apos;s the <unk> that you &apos;re normally using when you start a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is this notion of the <unk> <unk> of the character .
i &apos;ve got a style , it &apos;s really hard to get out of , because it &apos;s not clear , it &apos;s just <unk> .
running away , not far . i &apos;m going to fire : &quot; bang ! &quot; the <unk> falls between two <unk> cars .
if he was writing on a <unk> , i was in front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and films , but i also do <unk> , books and a little bit of advertising , all with the same concept .
from photography , this <unk> , it makes desire and <unk> . what you can &apos;t have , you want to get more .
as you <unk> into collective consciousness , we have no idea that you know , and how that happens .

it was more , how much life is left there ?
and then we have our <unk> , that you really never say to me , how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .

each of them can change changes , and they can <unk> to <unk> work , even if they don &apos;t know anything from the existence of the other they before .
this is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing on the right .
something more <unk> , which can happen to a culture is that you can acquire a new <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , now that &apos;s right ?

and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in the process of thinking about the next few rovers , which we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you , the last time that these are the airbags of really cool things .
there were two <unk> that were particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s kind of like the circulation on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can be no water because water would be frozen .
today , i want to talk about how these exponentially growing technologies are to understand .
so , let &apos;s look at how exponentially growing technology is affecting health .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there are wireless <unk> .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us to be connected to our patients and take more time to focus on the key , human elements of medicine that will be augmented by this kind of technology .
now , the current trend in medicine is to be exponentially small .
let &apos;s get genomics , when about 10 years ago , the first human was done , was the cost of about a billion dollars .
so , thanks to websites like <unk> like me , or the power of your data on <unk> <unk> or google health , it will always be more important , all of these possibilities for a more useful way .
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient heart attack , we found a better <unk> and higher <unk> of their own <unk> <unk> cells to a heart attack .

you design something like a mobile phone , and in a very mathematical language , you &apos;re describing this mobile phone .
this is normal dna that you hold for normal dna .
we heat them , put some salt , they heat them almost until the <unk> and cool them , and as the <unk> <unk> , the short strands of the long and it &apos;s forming a structure .
so this works really good , and you can build patterns and forms , ok ?
you zoom in , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you &apos;re just sitting on your seats to use to other tiles if you fit .
we have a very <unk> program , where small changes -- tiny , single mutations -- something that created a square of a size and it makes something much bigger .
and the ones used are <unk> , and to understand that and to understand that and get it better to handle , like feynman said , we have to build something to understand it .

this was the paper that i was writing about 11 years and i got a <unk> .
i have some , that was the long time : between five and 15 , this should be my <unk> and that led to a sense of failure .
so when i look at creativity , i think , is that there &apos;s this sense to <unk> the <unk> that i &apos;m seeing between practically everything .
this is what a buddhist fisherman will say , because they don &apos;t have to kill any living .
and you &apos;ll get more likely to get more attention .
and i had to find what would find what was going on to the story .
how are we going to be <unk> , what are the responsibility and the causes , outside of a dish ?
and you have to be in all the possibilities , including those i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you &apos;ll see it when i &apos;m going to get these examples , because i &apos;m really talking about everything you might spend your time .
there &apos;s papers about water .
people are paying the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is they don &apos;t have anything in common .
the corners of <unk> , on the center , is the big market .
these guys are <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be fully <unk> .
so what you have to do is find out who &apos;s interested in .
nine months later , i went out on tahrir square , and there was a picture i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
most of the time , cultural heritage is going to come back and to <unk> the past .
my first story for national geographic , which i realized that you can environmental health issues in a story about the history of nature , i had dedicated to <unk> .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with them -- i wanted to do another , more positive history about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i left out of <unk> , i learned that this habitat will become <unk> to create a new <unk> .
they also <unk> into <unk> .
but when the fish came back and again , and sea urchins and the population , the population , grew forest from kelp in the shallow water .
she now lives in the jungle of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , your second son , by the way , the son of the second of the second of the second that i &apos;ve saved .
it was a biological desert .
then you see the returns and starts to measure what &apos;s coming out .
so how did we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to sequester the nitrogen and without those microbes that you don &apos;t have to deal with .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we really can change the climate .
in <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law to protect the law to protect the system .
the <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll show you one another .
<unk> <unk> creates <unk> sculptures , beautiful works , which are moving into the pattern , or <unk> <unk> , and in nine minutes , he <unk> us with his <unk> art -- the same inspired by math and nature .
every city has its own design .
23 years later , you were going to be asked us to come and this idea .
this is italian desire , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the japanese place , german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or something , but not in any case of science .
people always say that consciousness was hard to define .
you can &apos;t have a <unk> of the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital program in the brain and to make consciousness , we have to just find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly getting the objectivity and subjectivity as the properties of reality and the attributes of all standards .
... don &apos;t you find ?
but i also meet people who love what they do , and they couldn &apos;t imagine something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear any <unk> .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , no , no .
i couldn &apos;t get this thing to work , no matter how often i do .
but we need to change from an industrial model to a <unk> shift , where tomorrow can be every single school .
erez and i wanted to figure out more .
the reason for this is that the historic report is going to be <unk> at the speed of the historic .
and then she went to a light . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s serious .
she introduced a group of students in a protest in the streets of cairo .
i was on , i made a tea , put me up and everything , and i &apos;m here -- still , but it &apos;s still a paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct <unk> , they <unk> the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy , &quot; with <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
it &apos;s not that a <unk> thing .
in fact , chris worried worried about him , and he said , &quot; look , show you this photograph , you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists that aren &apos;t much . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for mind .
and the solution that i &apos;m going to do is to look at the largest <unk> in this massive <unk> of the earth , and the way that i &apos;m passionate about is the world &apos;s <unk> destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t from the counter -- we call it <unk> where you &apos;re calling the effects , in the denominator -- we call it <unk> , put it in , where you put the effects ? &quot;
and he was a huge violation of the market that has increased our sales and revenues .
we &apos;ve literally won <unk> .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in atlanta .
so , frankly , in fact , there are many of us who work in the industry , that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly <unk> .
and it &apos;s true , we need someone to give us to give us a experience that we have a experience with a mentally divine ?
the arts , whatever you do , and then every time you care about us , you get a sense of looking at our way to <unk> and curiosity .
three sisters of <unk> <unk> <unk> with her passionate music , <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; by david <unk> , and then they play a <unk> <unk> version of <unk> <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the manchester craftsmen <unk> is named after my own .
he makes a bunch of money through this specialized furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american <unk> , which is what the harvard of the <unk> is the <unk> harvard , and we <unk> a <unk> for mothers in the middle of this <unk> in the middle of the inner city .
we &apos;ve seen that you have to give you flowers and the sunlight and the <unk> and expectations and herbie &apos;s music , and you can always heal the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given from public schools , who are flying by public school , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and food and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked pretty well .
and i will allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and should you ever decide to sell you to sell you to get an agreement to say that the money is used to support school . &quot;
this is a room that i built , you &apos;ve been built on the record record in our school in the christmas .
the brown building , which you &apos;ve looked at , and i &apos;m telling you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me afterwards , he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people who were deported .
bill <unk> shares a calm and amazing story of salvation through art , music and unusual .
and the transducer is to bring the <unk> to the code , and the result is a <unk> that produces a normal <unk> .
but there was a <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how you could let cells better answers to make a normal response and that was our contribution .
they cover us with a invisible <unk> , which attacks from the environment , so that we remain healthy .
but if bacteria grow and expanding and all of them , they all involve making these molecules , then the number of these molecules are being proportional to the <unk> proportional to the <unk> .
now we know that all of bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a <unk> of her skin .
bacteria have become incredibly <unk> , which is the point that we kill with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and that they &apos;re able to do tasks that they would never make possible if they were just going to be as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to get to this conference , to me .
or the first ones come in the hall .
but if we think about justice , aristotle tells you what we need to think about , is the actual character of the most valuable activity and qualities that are worth that you &apos;re admired and <unk> .
what would you have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , how he <unk> it .
so aristotle has <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> question of same-sex marriage replacement <unk> of same-sex marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> don &apos;t have to say what we should start with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humankind shall make a decision .
if that &apos;s like that , what does that mean ?
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the <unk> will be enough .
i &apos;m going to argue that that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get any <unk> symptoms before we get to an <unk> age , and even though the damage is our birth <unk> .
that means you have to do your homework and understand if this is true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read somewhere that in the last 20 years , average life expectancy of virtually every planet around 10 years .
not one of your media media has been doing this .
we don &apos;t care how we make our profit .
they <unk> into the center of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
i can &apos;t present a <unk> , the <unk> , as the case i &apos;ve learned from economists , epidemiologists and <unk> .
the <unk> is a little eerie , and you probably know a part of the <unk> .
fourteen americans die of asthma , who are three times like the 90s , almost everything from <unk> .
he was also making sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> are terrified to the <unk> as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
secondly , because we &apos;ve been hacked .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and paid people for this , every <unk> you saw .
he &apos;s going to think he might ever have a <unk> baby ever , so he might have a little bit help from the outside .
i asked peter , believe something changed . and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we want to talk to africa now : the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s a healthy , <unk> , beautiful african .
but most of all , they have to productive in their lives , and they have a kind of productive environment in our countries doing things that are done .
we can do it all together ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl through the legs of these people , with my sister to my back to find a window .
you know , we have to use everything .
and i often see a african employees among them .
the question is now , how do we use all of this good will that &apos;s coming to us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective a product product , i took this proposition to so we can study them , just like we can study any other neurological processes .
the method has been done since the 90s , to investigate extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games , change .
how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in <unk> .
i want to say that , why , and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and <unk> .
it &apos;s very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not just pleasant .
but keep the thoughts for the entire time of eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , can be used to be used to control a avatar or virtual character .
and they &apos;re not a <unk> <unk> , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so they die .
another statement of plato was that we &apos;re reacting to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s produced by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in her <unk> , a very cheap piece of cotton .
audience : aye .
and what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve got all the time , we &apos;ve never done it , the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant <unk> house .
and you see this <unk> you see here , actually grows in a <unk> which was turned around and <unk> .
so water is a very important aspect .
&quot; metal and &quot; earth &quot; are still standing . &quot;
the idea is not sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touch the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we recorded these two genomes , we said , if this could be the smallest genome of a species of view of a species of view , it could even be a smaller genome from that ?
and the other thing that was clear that once that worked , it would have been a real chance to get if we could get the synthetic chromosome , it would make the bacteria .
care is <unk> .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , which i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we &apos;re living here in the northwest , very close to the koran &apos;s notion of paradise , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> by <unk> .
but the more you add , the more likely to go .
and that number of 72 comes never .
this is a nest entrance colony , and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been founded by a queen of the previous summer .
the <unk> -- this is supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group . they go early morning , before the first group of foraging .
but interestingly , it looks like half of the ant just just does anything .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the <unk> and put them up to the <unk> edges of the <unk> and put it there .
the foragers do somehow , but somehow , not get out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer is an ant outside , the more easy <unk> , the more easy <unk> of their surface , so that smell ants different , they do different work .
they &apos;re headed all the earth beyond antarctica .
here you see the cost of this for the world in about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world population .
this has nothing to do with it .
i &apos;ve been thinking about where we can use natural gas .
and when i got to get the <unk> , we took natural gas to the <unk> .
why do you not care ?
so they have just 500 million .
and it never became the water of <unk> , or something like that .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
life &apos;s life is an event . let &apos;s say it .
these are work in <unk> manhattan , where you built the first <unk> of the first market .
there were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to go into light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t just get and wait , but then the <unk> , when they were there , they had to call them , &quot; they had to call somebody .
so i &apos;m going to use a clinical language , and so it may not be very warm about the heart as it &apos;s about to other conversations with compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> <unk> are for people to get <unk> for people who are going to be <unk> .
basically , it &apos;s about when you &apos;re my enemy or my favorite <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m going to be much less , you &apos;re using the golden rule on you . okay .
so , the results up to each other . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of interdependence , <unk> , force one , the humanity of the other people .
and they &apos;re explaining to them , the other people think that america wants to be not respected , and they &apos;re actually going to dominate it .
most of the diseases relate to poverty , but in case of cancer , kids who died in cancer , mostly from <unk> families .
a week , a child died , but nothing changed .
because you don &apos;t simply have that kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
and so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant <unk> would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell , and that they do a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that had the right extracellular matrix , and lo and behold , within about four days , you were going to see the <unk> and the right , you see what we &apos;ve made in a culture .
and of course , we &apos;re now asking ourselves where we &apos;re going to go ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
we &apos;ve been journalists to journalists a <unk> journalists who was caught in the <unk> ; a young <unk> , so many <unk> quotes that you took it from the shelves ; a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise .
you had four good friends of their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lie ; they were talking about , and then they were on .
they told how big the bath was , or they said , the <unk> are so far from the hotel .
woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a photograph !
and you also want to <unk> your eyes .
but it really has opened my eyes , how often i &apos;ve been excluded from life for emails , social networks and so on , although there &apos;s actually nothing really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful tape from <unk> .
and everybody who went back to the <unk> .
at least for me , because if i always do the same thing , i &apos;m very boring to , very boring , i &apos;m very quick to get very quickly .
i look like i &apos;m -- i don &apos;t know when i see .
are you going to be nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
how always i &apos;m saying is it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
if you have a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to be buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship of the citizenship -- what people are different backgrounds or race , but yet , but as citizens are going to be equal .
and of course , i was discovered in egypt .
this was this in london , in yemen , and on <unk> on amsterdam an airplane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are looking for democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , bin laden &apos;s got <unk> the richest , <unk> <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition that happened to a political goal , and that was to get the leaders .
these tools are only going to be very difficult to be bored .
he <unk> the limits of the individual networks and then <unk> them .
and because of social networking students , they studied from abroad abroad , or companies from the rest of the world in china , there were people around the world that were listening to the news .
and finally , the chinese chinese .
we are always global warming , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but it &apos;s all <unk> , i &apos;m still going to take a look like this .
my fourth <unk> to everest , a comet exploded over the mountain .
this is a view of the <unk> up , the first 600 feet of the climb of base camp .
and this is in camp camp .
and there were some climbers on this summit .
we also got the bad news that beck <unk> , another climber , in this storm passed in the snow .
it &apos;s so promising to work up there , sometimes , actually , directly through the clothes .
this climber was <unk> .
and i just can just <unk> how he did that .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back into action .
these are the sherpas who light up <unk> .
and the fourth thing that is really important for me is , &quot; ideas that we have to share with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the <unk> , are entrepreneurs to be more models , and they &apos;re making a lot of the society in great .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy to do , because they &apos;re bringing ideas to bring the universal <unk> , parliament and the constitution and so on .
and the third thing is the cities .
the second is the <unk> that we have so hard to do , to make sure of all sorts of health jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs are in the <unk> area .
so if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to implement a modern <unk> of <unk> , so you don &apos;t actually have the <unk> , if you get older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important to the world .
so the government decides to let the government .
even though some people on the left left it was not to hear the revolution , the markets that were <unk> the <unk> , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the mass .
so this whole cascade of mistrust between the <unk> and those they &apos;re going .
<unk> .
each one of these <unk> would be statistically covered , two years after the <unk> .
david cameron spent 20 million pounds in a &quot; social enterprise fund , &quot; to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investing in social change
i &apos;m working on . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend called jack , i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m going to shake you , jack . <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom thum and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means i &apos;m all you just heard of , just with my voice , just with my voice .
and lastly , with this one , i can <unk> my sounds , <unk> , repeat again .
our people had to try to find a <unk> about 5,000 different sets of <unk> to find the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do . everybody can do that .
on the right side , you see a <unk> .
and i &apos;ll give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> <unk> .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
many of these patients are taking the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical ones .
he can stop the surgery at any time and right now .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really <unk> lots of creative inspiration . so it &apos;s a industry that runs both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and you can get this as quickly as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , really just in this aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and the <unk> who decided that would be much too much too much .
these are the two <unk> quite binary , in the logic of the <unk> .
and i want to thank you to this point , <unk> , really , that she has created this very <unk> presentation .
i once put a boat to a remote <unk> , and i realized that the <unk> i should meet , not <unk> .
i think this is one of the most <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there &apos;s a number of ancient <unk> on <unk> all over the u.k. , if you &apos;re going to do that , you &apos;ll note that the <unk> were in the churches .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope that by making these organisms , can help to make it easy to protect their remarkable <unk> , and my part of protection that can be able to do to protect their <unk> longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s put it into something else .
20 years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they also make their own <unk> , like this , that &apos;s used by the <unk> of mexico in all 31 .
what did they do with this ?
what could terrorists do today , using this now available to the current technology ?
recently , the fbi has been arrested for the united states , which <unk> <unk> <unk> to transportation <unk> in <unk> in the united states .
and as we see here , we turn into <unk> .
now , mortality rates are 70 percent if you get it , but that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s so much people being murdered , that the only <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> is to not <unk> like this one from the <unk> juarez .
but then i hear people talking about fear , a certain emotional response to the risk of the risk .
and tragically , she was working in colombia , when she was working in colombia with the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , with the goal of her culture and language , with two other colleagues at the farc , and was killed and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more likely to be more likely to be more likely than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people , the simple solutions , mild categories because we don &apos;t consider profit as an instrument .
but the whole community , all of different <unk> , including <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and praying . &quot;
because the <unk> , if you &apos;re full of juice , you &apos;re beautiful , it &apos;s green , you &apos;re feeding the world , it &apos;s all enough to the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
okay , let &apos;s take a look at these three portraits .
i tried to do a little bit of joy .
why do i ask for my wife for my wife , was <unk> ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is making sanitary pad cotton and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why do you <unk> a damn ? &quot;
now , 110 countries are available . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was always there seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training . i swam and forth in <unk> .
it was actually happening that the cells were going into my fingers and go to <unk> .
and my good friend david saw how i was thinking , and he came up and said , &quot; lewis , i know you &apos;ve been 18 years old .
the prospect that they could die in 30 , 40 years is a very <unk> .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about <unk> trillion cubic <unk> of oil oil on earth today , which can be compiled and nurtured .
now , the end of the story -- okay , we &apos;re just replacing this with conventional , renewable resources -- but i think that &apos;s a little more about that .
specifically , that the abalone shell itself is creating , millions of abalone abalone , every year , every year .
and the idea was basically , i &apos;m the <unk> of the great personalities that come and i would interview .
but i wanted to see interviews that are different .
in fact , my first <unk> george was the secretary of the age of 97 , and was a full of life life -- i think it &apos;s how you can define it .
we know the big <unk> , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to say , and the meaning of the thing is , to make it just silly silly .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t that <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my <unk> .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand this . &quot;
half of the body was not , the other people don &apos;t .
this is a <unk> in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to make any nice things .
there &apos;s a certain way of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the painting we would have painted , but what we actually did .
another example : again , a silly mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million dollars , 20 million dollars on the swiss <unk> , in <unk> , from the ministers of the presidents , the high public government in the state of state .
they even <unk> that .
most of the big companies are now <unk> that they have to be very strict policies in order to bribe .
if you want to go into a restaurant , if you look at the menu , then you would expect to order it to the map ?
and this was the first time that i thought that the expression of her face is actually reflects what she &apos;s holding .
well , he divides his life .
this french painter in the 1700s was known for his life , but sometimes people .
unfortunately , there &apos;s a lot of time that are in the archive of the other , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was wearing it at a dinner table , which was given their parents to honor .
&quot; i congratulate you to your next wedding , james .
my father lived most of his <unk> in east africa .
i would like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our films , they are stories that are our people to identify with .
so it really has to be a young man out there , to think about the negative things and all this , or any kind of <unk> act .
<unk> : so much of you , so little time .
i think this is really the subject of this event .
i &apos;m going to do this as a <unk> , of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a <unk> .
now the art director . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really amazing .
video games can be very profound if they &apos;re totally <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show a portal , because you &apos;re sending to <unk> new spaces .
so , space , aesthetic , and then most importantly , behavior .
and i had to break a few bridges out of my head .
everything goes to the <unk> and students who are meeting from the first meeting that they will be a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and <unk> things that i normally draw .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever made .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife for me to be a <unk> .
and one day i had a -- oh , vice versa .
i &apos;ve gone down the <unk> and the copper and the very thin , so it <unk> .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was doing this kind of thing like my house so <unk> .
it was never finished .
the dome was a wish of <unk> .
it was a attempt to turn this little piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 to infinity -- in a property that you &apos;ve separated these areas and the home and dining dining room in this block <unk> , with a high space in it .
they call this &quot; plan &quot; <unk> . &quot;
here it is .
and in the back , it appears to be <unk> <unk> .
our minds don &apos;t want to be galleries , so -- and when we met our new <unk> , he told us that , or that was the right shape .
in barcelona i was asked to do a fish , we &apos;re working on the <unk> foot of the <unk> , which was built by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
can we not make a clean burning <unk> ?
and one of the things they found was that they didn &apos;t belong .
and this is our <unk> briquettes .
and he has the problem of the health impacts of <unk> wood and charcoal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this was india , in this room only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like the united states to put things on .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , it &apos;s all .
now , this is not surprising . but we also asked them to rate their honesty and intelligence , kindness and <unk> .
he got married . he had a son called <unk> .
is this business with our outside and our employment for a <unk> phenomenon ?
now , i want to tell a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are and where we want .
we can replace the air , the air , but we &apos;re not very far with replacing the <unk> .
my topic is food in schools because this is about social justice .
and the next is <unk> .
people talk about sustainability , but we should find out what that &apos;s at all .
do you know that everybody thinks you have to have more and more food ?
and they then <unk> , hey , we can sell that stuff to children .
and this is a typical <unk> .
the things that we might do at home , and to keep the things that we need to teach children in schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion dollars , by the way , two dollars and 49 cents -- so much money makes the government for lunch for lunch .
and when a little girl sitting in my grandfather at a hot <unk> with me outside .
if i go to a party , and people ask me what i &apos;m doing , because i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; your eyes .
i want to <unk> your <unk> , all of their <unk> nature , <unk> -- that they are a professional <unk> in things .
don &apos;t break the tension . i want to be <unk> .
it &apos;s a documentary of <unk> about consciousness .
when i came to mind , i expected to recognize all the details of most people , their dresses and so on .
how do you know that it was what you did ?
see it ? who &apos;s not going to be ? it &apos;s going to help .
we start <unk> . some examples .
today , jeff hawkins has described to his efforts , a good , big theory to bring in neuroscience .
and the <unk> in london said , &quot; what my she is with : &quot; who is in london for london -- &quot; i mean , no one &apos;s in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing have been introduced in stockholm , in stockholm , and the first picture , here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical street on the second .
so , we made this enormous survey with lots of <unk> and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to central <unk> -- from eastern europe to central asia -- through the hills of the caucasus , <unk> east , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the <unk> of the taliban , who are going to be <unk> the doors to the people who are going to send their daughters to schools like in <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was <unk> , i had the blue <unk> on the walls .
and there was two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is this ?
now , i want to talk about some other patients , all of the patients that are doing everything in their power to improve health .
and then i realized that i remembered the side of google earth , where we can fly to each address .
we are , they &apos;re most imaginative resource in health .
<unk> of seawater is a <unk> .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their control to the help of sound waves . i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
in the united states alone , the annual cost of <unk> <unk> are <unk> , and so we &apos;ve seen bats in the case of prosperity .
why should we deal with the age of all of the time ?
if you go out and see in the night sky and see this beautiful , flying animal night , i wish you smile . thank you .
europa had to be brought into economic development .
the booms of resources , <unk> <unk> , not all , but many countries are the bottom billion .
so , what does it go wrong ? why is there the so-called &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
and so the countries of the bottom billion a very <unk> politics .
a few economists came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to a heart ? it &apos;s going to reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people in poor or <unk> countries , how can we find them ? the economist paul collier is a <unk> , compassionate plan that we can close the gap between the arm and the realm .
we have no container where they are made .
and here &apos;s a case of a <unk> surgeons in africa that <unk> that is necessary to allow to use an <unk> .
so we have this : imagine this : imagine that a lecture and could talk to the people in their native language .
&quot; basics of surgery surgery .
14 years ago , i came to the ordinary material , <unk> , for centuries , for centuries .
he tells me if i could build this as a <unk> piece for the city .
so , we teamed up with little <unk> <unk> to generate a dry fog that will be shaped by the wind , and the test that turned out is that it can be shaped by people who are interacting with that and can move through it and move through the wind .
they were in their <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> alongside people they don &apos;t know , and shared the wonders of the miracle .
so , i became aware of that , that this is a tremendous risk for our societies .
if peter &apos;s arm , this yellow spot is going to be the same spot of the activity that would <unk> understand in <unk> .
if you do that , what are you going to control ?
and to say that that changes also can be <unk> over death , even a claim that can be true or wrong .
now let me just make a point of what i &apos;m not saying , i &apos;m not saying science can be secure in this room , or that we can have scientific answers to any <unk> moral question .
now , why would not be an objective morality to undermine ?
how high is the probability that this represents a cause of human development ?
on the left , you see edward <unk> .
we live in a world of <unk> technologies and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easier to break it than they &apos;re together together .
but then we need to talk again about well-being in a wider context .
and what is the natural enemy , what the means of the <unk> of the good beetle , which we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , no <unk> , but a <unk> wasp , two millimeters long , you know , a quick and <unk> <unk> .
and if we take these good <unk> to a <unk> plot , they go to the flowers .
in israel , for example , where we &apos;re on a thousand acres -- this is the equivalent 10,000 <unk> of <unk> -- biological <unk> circuits are using , they were 75 percent of pesticides &apos;s banned pesticides .
third , to increase the minds of the farmers to make this <unk> .
<unk> is one of my favorite features .
it &apos;s still <unk> about making the <unk> of the <unk> of the way than <unk> , i do a lot .
urban <unk> -- that &apos;s what new yorkers needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and so that -- i wasn &apos;t going to be <unk> enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the soviet union found only a few decades , maybe within a decade , after the soviet union , after the soviet union was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there , which is really insects eat .
they &apos;re at the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do these balls at all , and it &apos;s already in the soup , but it &apos;s still happening anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per year .
so we &apos;re going to decide to do that , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase a little bit of levels , but it &apos;s going to be a <unk> of a boundary .
and you may think , well , they &apos;re not available yet .
my three minutes is not begun , right ?
he then said , &quot; ah , we must put them on the table .
and i &apos;ve seen a sign .
even if you &apos;re <unk> the system , it &apos;s going to do it in a way that will benefit society .
and in this book , the little lewis might find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back , some other gadgets , <unk> , and scales to make some of these calculations . okay ?
right . so , this machine is used .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that &apos;s just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is called a strider .
this is just being used to show that if you have a camera or other sensors , because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s about 80 feet of 80 , you can <unk> over obstacles and <unk> .
for example : in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to the right , and therefore they &apos;re going to quickly turn around .
welcome to <unk> , the robot , relational happiness . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the <unk> .
let &apos;s see how he does . this was our first trial , and ... <unk> !
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just from a spark of imagination , is not enough .
and this is a very important way of education .
<unk> , who are going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s basically no pool of <unk> <unk> teachers , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a total empty variation in the creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the <unk> on the tire of the seats , then the team won .
but in the last few decades , but a lot of money that was meant for business , entirely gone .
and after walking and go outside and interview the neighbors what they buy and they &apos;re going from where , and why , is a homework .
in this one , it &apos;s impossible to create big <unk> space .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of <unk> and exploration .
four months of the rainy season , <unk> it and now , he &apos;d have eight months before .
here &apos;s a few results .
this global action is going to lead to climate change , as it &apos;s about fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i learned from these two things , i <unk> this very , both of the personal reasons as well as science .
it has a very <unk> <unk> <unk> that was partly <unk> by the soviet <unk> foundation .
after treatment , we let the child a week a series of simple <unk> to see how his vision is .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to follow these <unk> and hopefully have more results to report .
and then i &apos;ve been from these <unk> to physically disabled disabled disabled disabled , i thought , oh i don &apos;t know , but before i think about it , i &apos;ll look at how this is like this .
but this was in the autumn of <unk> , and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then aimee travels into the <unk> in 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travel with -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i was trying to get everybody who &apos;s <unk> , who am against whom am i performing ?
i &apos;ve been going all of everything , and now i thought , what ?
you can be big . take it off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designers are being at ted <unk> 2 and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
they were a <unk> person who came over and the shoes .
but almost impossible to see the actual <unk> of the economy , it &apos;s because , we use math .
or for the long , the total jobs .
and something about the mathematics : math looks sometimes like math -- like math here -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to step three of hand .
if people ask me , is that true ?
but the automation of cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s driving today , and this is what &apos;s going to build a car and learn about it .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both the same time .
and one of the reasons that &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the exams .
it was in the winter of 2009 , and i was blind for about a year .
i thought about my father , who passed away from complications of complications of a surgery .
similarly , just through the handle of the <unk> that can make changing nature of the ground , and with the time , a notion of where you are and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was then <unk> and broadway , i was blessed to everybody .
if you design a city in the mind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of experience , the article was called &quot; i think you &apos;re every <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous ones i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next , is being healed and <unk> .
you give money for a good purpose , and it &apos;s an emotional pursuit of purpose .
she &apos;s not a book that was written written by the sky .
so , for me , this is actually the key to the happiness of the happiness , remember that on the path , the car doesn &apos;t go away , and i don &apos;t get up on the road .
i was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to make a sense of this book , then we really need to get to the <unk> and with it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics that these work was thought about being <unk> , so we &apos;ve developed <unk> applications like this <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> of a <unk> on a <unk> will be a laser .
alex worked on a small , a little obscure , independent <unk> with the name &quot; minority report &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to develop the interface that would be used in the movie .
we &apos;re going to do this <unk> operation , because we like yellow and <unk> on green <unk> .
let &apos;s go apart , i &apos;m going to bring it into <unk> .
we , as humans , are the ones that make things and we should make sure that our machines are helping us to build on it .
john , thank you to make a reality science for reality .
what okolloh did would be not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most promising creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re going to change this deal .
they are created by the members of the community for each other .
and like all of the good <unk> , they make a leap from 20 years when the interest of the audience changes .
you &apos;ve never been available for five days , so , and so we started playing <unk> .
india was not planned to play the <unk> .
the other was <unk> cricket .
was this new india ? this was another world where you could get the player from anywhere , as long as you get the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve all had games in calcutta , but something we had never seen before . <unk> khan has brought the audience to a <unk> song for <unk> -- not for india , but for <unk> .
could you imagine that this day would come from ?
hopefully i have a long time to get a experience of richer , and the game is more popular and hopefully , there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the smartest dogs is , because they &apos;ve been able to have their memory rate , how often they have dogs and pigs on leashes on the ground .
why in the world should anyone play ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country and you can buy a <unk> for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your <unk> 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and when the way to the other end of the city of 100 mice is worth of a <unk> of mice , it &apos;s 100 <unk> worth , completely no matter any way you &apos;re going to be saved , but people don &apos;t think so .
well , in large and all , you &apos;re enormous <unk> .
watch what happens when we &apos;re leaving <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more , you say , our response to terrorism is , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no guns .
and so some people see when economists do as a stupid people .
and the variation and the variation is one of these <unk> that requires certain intellectual activity , because you always have the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
-- &quot; look in words and fashion is the same rule as a result , as being new or too , not the first thing new experiment , and yet the last one was going to be the old driver . &quot;
and i woke up one day and i said , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s not all that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to be in a critical audience without not suggesting i was too sure .
it &apos;s my intention to leave the poster <unk> , you should not have understood it .
so , in large and all of our economic , they &apos;re our survival .
jews often have a <unk> smell .
if the room air , we were seeing that people were more negative attitudes towards <unk> men .
it &apos;s as though i was going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in this 20 years of years .
it supports my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
i was sick .
we don &apos;t need a problem more out of the idiots !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea that we have all of these children , it &apos;s a generation , we have a generation of children who had to go through such a psychological trauma or needing to go through and africa needs to live .
through the whole book , it &apos;s going to pull over an hour of <unk> <unk> and interactive animations .
so what is the business ?
and it &apos;s at least seems that you could , whatever you could , but mostly , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s definitely a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about this .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you were <unk> on the spanish <unk> on the roofs and those things .
rsw : how about his schedule ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve been interviewed me for mit and have sent their technical <unk> to bilbao .
it reminded me about it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; what can i do for you , mr. cheese ? &quot;
if you want to go for four months with three wishes , the ideas are becoming more and more and more clearer and more .
and one thing i wanted to mention in my <unk> , but i had missed , it was to thank everybody who helped me to get this .
but in the meanwhile , these things are going to gain .
and this is a decade later , by hand <unk> .
you see the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> and things is remarkable , and this is supposed to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an amazing endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think five and the sixth will be built here .
at this level , it &apos;s about 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computers in the world will end up to the recycling of the world in china .
it was quite unusual , so , not , less than 5 percent of the advertising had the subject of the main topic .
and wish three is : <unk> . i was told to make myself a job , and i always wanted to do anything like this .
and it &apos;s becoming more important that we find out how we can gain these materials from this extremely complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of separate material , just doesn &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional path , make <unk> , is going to be oil or petrochemicals .
in the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different kinds of <unk> and many different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should investigate how monkeys make choices make economic choices and to find whether they make the same <unk> as we do .
here &apos;s a <unk> . you will be a token for food and you &apos;re waiting for you to get it .
you &apos;re waiting a <unk> to open the market .
now imagine that i &apos;m touching every one of a thousand <unk> dollars in your hand -- so 10 <unk> a hundred dollars of rock .
you can either pick a <unk> loss -- like , i throw a coin . at a head , you &apos;re going to lose a lot of lose .
if we made in our little <unk> the same scenarios , they would do the same things as people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development that make stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the hook .
but if we think about the nest maintenance , they &apos;re just four stories tall .
we have to have to go through and steel and we need to build higher , and we &apos;ve been working on <unk> <unk> .
this is just as much as we would have a year of 900 cars fewer cars than we did .
<unk> <unk> <unk> my window .
perhaps even &quot; citizen , &quot; because recently they stood up , to fight the <unk> of justice , the citizens of these networks together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the russian government , is using the russian government , now , is to provide <unk> and citizens into developing innovations with people .
we &apos;ve heard talks about ted to ted , which have hacked by the <unk> , and <unk> , working on the world young people , to make websites and turn them on .
and so i began to think that the eternal mother always says , &quot; are all the children ? &quot;
that &apos;s empathy .
he asked them to communicate a message , and they all read into their own language in their own language , which was a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want you to do you , the <unk> don &apos;t have to do it . &quot;
a pastor is to say that these individual needs need to take a needs .
and we do this by some <unk> .
there &apos;s been over 500,000 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken from parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber optics .
there are also some barriers to his illumination .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend because we don &apos;t have food , and we were about 400 .
as a kid as young and <unk> , words i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
that &apos;s my story , sharing a lesson of a memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , my lunch , i foundation a foundation that i founded , because we &apos;re trying to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give us the farmers .
audience : aye .
the third chapter is a little more complicated <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are in favor .
we solve this problem , we &apos;re going to extend the problem of death .
and even if that &apos;s happening , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from the time i was five years old .
santa <unk> : whether you were <unk> or not . right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were so ready for the school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiled , and they were going to say , &quot; believe that we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on earth ? &quot;
maybe your greater capacity to cooperate and adapt to adapt ?
i think this film shows the most important view of modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that there &apos;s a fundamental contribution to do it , and that &apos;s how many resources we use .
but now , good news !
it may be in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptics and the <unk> of climate change in vision .
and a big program , we did a project for <unk> , and it was like : the <unk> -- with many , many people -- lots of people -- all of experts -- all of the experts -- all of the experts -- all of their <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> .
a group of asking you to spend it for yourself and the other group should spend it for other people .
when you went from the first building to the second , all of the way that compose and <unk> , and clearly <unk> help . the question is : did it and helped ?
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; &quot; &#93; : the hidden life of <unk> things .
since now , four decades -- i &apos;ve been practicing with the best in this field , had been practicing with the best in this field , had young and old teaching , created , <unk> , <unk> , a rich web of art , both and <unk> .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my strength , my energy , my passion , my actual life life .
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and scraping it to be able to adapt to my <unk> .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s how it was .
he put them together , and he &apos;s combined this , and then he put them into this software , which i think was originally designed his son , and he has this wonderful presentation .
these documents are little <unk> , little boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , you create a nice website , and how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make beautiful website ?
now , ask the linked data that you have now put together , 32 hits , each one of which each one is with these attributes , and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what linked data is about .
all of this will lead that every year two million children fewer die , in the last year , when 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to <unk> and to collect feedback , and to make sure that the promise of you get results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that number ?
my brothers started to draw on the drawing and drawing on .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m intrigued with , is to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow , you know , go from bangalore to <unk> ?
it &apos;s only that we &apos;re trained as people to perceive the reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; go fine .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re an artist ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because if we see somebody &apos;s going down , we see the footprint .
what percentage of that was turned out of this ?
obviously , he &apos;s been in a cave last 20,000 years .
so the <unk> is actually being very appropriate to get here to end , because if you think about it , i &apos;ve been thinking about the among economists <unk> , the most things that most of things are very perceptive .
this is the place that i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re now going to do something more technical .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t <unk> it , so you accept it and find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza is take pizza if you have hunger .
there are millions of different <unk> .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and the activity , you &apos;re thinking about baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet <unk> chen , and it goes like , &quot; i can &apos;t bear it just <unk> .
and that is , &quot; how much percent of the day do you think about this person ? &quot;
in the course of 100 societies , people have leaving the <unk> <unk> of these <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it became a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are <unk> than women ? &quot;
no time on this was the women , the women were so educated , so interesting .
she has been her since she was 13 since .
i started to <unk> why you &apos;re more like in love with one person than in the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is based on what shakespeare called &quot; this <unk> spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know .
most researchers think obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves if it could be that the insulin resistance causes the cause of weight and <unk> disease -- at least most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much more nuanced .
peter <unk> : what if our views were wrong about diabetes ?
my grandfather , henry ford , he really thought that the mission of ford motor motor company was to improve people &apos;s lives and make cars for everybody affordable .
and the good news is that we &apos;re today to get big trouble from cars and environment -- not just for ford , but as an industry .
i think you can imagine .
what i really inspired , but really , the possibilities we are going to do when our cars start communicating with each other .
we need an infrastructure that &apos;s able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute of <unk> .
i think now , i think , i think i was kind of a <unk> .
and then the nurses have to go into data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s essential . &quot;
so what &apos;s out of it ?
it &apos;s been great for us , because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , at the time , when a student of a <unk> , i was going to sing that really , i thought , was a <unk> and many <unk> <unk> with me .
now it &apos;s just about the kids . we don &apos;t smoke .
basically , we gave kids a simple job .
for our auction , we have some wonderful pictures for you , for a really good purpose , the money that you give us is to buy aids .
